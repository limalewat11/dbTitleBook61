In truth, the rural locale provides the perfect front for the father-daughter NSA operatives as they expertly carry out their mission: using a high-tech computer system, they protect a team of undercover agents. Some would kill to have access to this system, and it makes Charlotte and her father prime targets. It was only a matter of time before this nightmare unexpectedly crashed down on them, and only Charlotte escaped with her life. Before Dwight Martin died, though, he initiated the failsafe lockdown, and now Charlotte's the only one who can access the system.<p>Writer Jake Bradford left the serene Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia for the hustle and bustle New York to pursue his dreams and never looked back. Until now. Entrusted with his ailing grandmother's care, Jake knows he needs help and he can't believe his luck when a lovely young woman providentially appears on his doorstep. Charlotte creates a new persona for herself and quickly develops a bond with Jake's grandmother. But it's the connection she feels with Jake that makes it almost too easy to lose sight of her reality: she is being hunted by men who will stop at nothing to access the intelligence she protects. With time running out, can the couple find a future together, or will Charlotte's secrets tear them apart?</p></p><p>Originally from Arizona, Traci Hunter Abramson has spent most of her adult life in Virginia.

Inexplicably, the advanced culture vanished from the pages of history...until a set of their special stones was discovered by Anlon&#x2019;s uncle, archaeologist Devlin Wilson.Devlin was brutally murdered, leaving behind the stones and a set of confounding clues. An ancient map, a curious statue and three cryptic journals. Somehow, the clues are linked. But how? That&#x2019;s the puzzling mystery Anlon must solve.And time is not on his side...for there are others seeking to solve the same riddle...heartless fiends who crave the most fearsome of the magnetic stones...the Flash Stone.Forged as a building tool, the Flash Stone can cut and shape rock with astounding precision.

Each side was forced to confront its prejudices and fears, and examine the merits and flaws of its ideology. Then, an astonishing thing happened: in their rural isolation, sharing harsh weather conditions and the pinch of wartime rationing, friendships began to develop. Prisoners and their guards sometimes even worked together to meet the daily pulpwood quotas, and little handmade gifts to the local villagers cemented friendships that continue to this day.</p><p>5 1/2 x 8 1/2 trim. 15 illus.

Author Stuart Alve Olson, a student of T. T. Liang, draws on the lineages of Masters Feng Huan-I and Wang Han-Fon, but includes detailed description of all major schools, styles, and lineages. The first half of the book focuses on tactics and theory; the second half contains step-by-step descriptions of the fundamental Praying Mantis stances, exercises, footwork, and kicks, clearly illustrated by more than 200 photographs. What sets this book apart from other works on Praying Mantis is its philosophical depth; author Olson gives a clear account of the development of the art and the Taoist principles from which it arose. This book provides the basis for not only mastering the martial art of Praying Mantis Kung Fu but also mastering oneself&#x2014;the true goal of all martial arts.</p><p>Stuart Alve Olson has taught martial arts worldwide and is the author of <i>Steal My Art: The Life and Times of Tai Chi Master T.T.

"Will delight the young viewer. An excellent introduction to pond ecology, and a strikingly beautiful book."--Kirkus Reviews.</p><p>It is dawn at Long Pond. Box Turtle's red eyes look out from his shelter within a crumbling tree, and his day begins ...</p><p>In <em>Beaver at Long Pond</em>, the Georges introduced the pond and its resident. In this lyrical, magnificently painted companion book, they insure its place as a favorite spot on every child's itinerary.</p></p><p>William T. George created <em>Christmas at Long Pond</em> and <em>Beaver at Long Pond </em>together with his wife, Lindsay Barrett George. Mr. George died in 1999.<br><br><p>Lindsay Barrett George is widely recognized for her striking illustrations of animals, birds, and fish in their habitats. She is the author-illustrator of <em>Maggie&#x2019;s Ball</em>; <em>Alfred Digs</em>; <em>The Secret</em>; <em>Inside Mouse, Outside Mouse</em>; <em>In the Garden: Who&#x2019;s Been Here?</em>; and four other <em>Who&#x2019;s Been Here?</em> titles. </p><p>Lindsay Barrett George lives in northeastern Pennsylvania with her dog, two cats, and a very handsome duck.</p>PreSchool-Grade 2-- A day in the life of a box turtle is rendered carefully in words and lifelike illustrations with a text that respects its subject, avoids any anthropomorphism, and is simple enough for very young listeners. It records the turtle's actions as, slowly but with perseverance, he drinks, searches for food, evades danger, and sleeps. The outstanding gouache paintings in borderless, horizontal two-page spreads are so realistic that one almost reaches out to feel the turtle's textured shell. Although at times the turtle seems to be camouflaged, blending into his surroundings, he stands out clearly once located. The animals he encounters are equally well illustrated--readers will almost hold their breath so as not to frighten the raccoon and chipmunk. The book's design is excellent; even the well-chosen type, superimposed on the illustrations so that there is no visual break from the scenes, is clear and easily read. This is superior nature study for young readers and listeners. --Louise L. Sherman, Anna C.

Take a moment right now and think <em>There's a hungry grizzly bear sitting next to me.</em> Chances are you didn't take that thought literally and run screaming from the room. But what if instead you had thought, <em>I'll never get a better job,</em> <em>I'm boring,</em> or <em>No one loves me?</em> Just like that terrifying grizzly, these more garden-variety thoughts are just words and pictures that pop into our minds. But often we take thoughts like these literally and let them trick us into avoiding the lives we really want to live.</p> <p><strong>Leave Your Mind Behind</strong> offers a collection of light-hearted practices readers can use to learn to observe their thoughts without getting caught up in them. Each practice is grounded in a component of the new acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) called cognitive defusion: the process of de-fusing or not identifying or becoming one with your thoughts. Sometimes downright strange&#x2014;imagine yourself hearing your thoughts in the voice of a headless monster!&#x2014;these activities don't seek to stop or control problematic thinking. Instead, they work to show readers how to observe thoughts without judgment and learn to live with the confounding and marvellous word-making, story-telling machine that is the human mind.</p></p><p>This illuminating little book offers readers insight into how our thoughts work (sometimes against us) to shape our perceptions and experiences. It includes fifty fun, engaging activities readers can learn in seconds and practice any time to learn to watch and let go of troubling thoughts.<b>Matthew McKay, PhD</b>, is a professor at the Wright Institute in Berkeley, CA.

However, it was in this rich region that a heresy of Eastern origin took hold, forcing the Catholic Church to confront a rival whose teachings questioned the foundations of Christian thought. These heretics, called Cathars, held a profoundly pessimistic view of the world that was based on the duality of all things, including good and evil: according to one heretic, "The one, the good God, made the invisible world, while the other, the evil God, made the visible one."<br><br>Jonathan Sumption's acclaimed history examines the roots of this heresy as well as of the crusade the Church undertook in 1208 to stamp out the infidels, who ultimately were conquered by the Catholic armies. But this book does more than simply describe this terrible war; it reconstructs a lost world of great cultural richness, one that saw the creation in Languedoc of the troubadour tradition as well as the magnificent castles at Cabaret and Carcassonne.<br></p><p><b>Jonathan Sumption</b> is the author of <i>Trial by Battle</i> and <i>Trial by Fire</i>, the first two volumes of his history of the Hundred Years' War. He lives in England.<br>"An admirably luicid account of the tragic demise of Languedoc's unique civilisation . . . Scholarship carried with �lan."--<i>R.L. Storey, The Times (London)</i><br><br>"Excellent . . . A model of sound history written with style and intelligence for the non-specialist reader."--<i>Listener</i><br><br>"Sumption writes with fluent scholarship and with amiable and ironic succinctness. He never fails to keep his narrative lively with the particular and the pertinent. He is excellent on the tactics and spirit of medieval warfare."<br>--Frederic Raphael, <i>Sunday Times</i><br></p><h2>The Quantum Self</h2><p><p>In <em>The Quantum Self</em>, Danah Zohar argues that the insights of modem physics can illuminate our understanding of everyday life -- our relationships to ourselves, to others, and to the world at large. Guiding us through the strange and fascinating workings of the subatomic realm to create a new model of human consciousness, the author addresses enduring philosophical questions. Does the new physics provide a basis by which our consciousness might continue beyond death? How does the material world (for instance, ugly inner cities) impinge upon our sense of self? Is there a subatomic wellspring from which our creativity, our empathy with others, and our feelings of unity with the inanimate world originate?</p><p>Most important, Zohar shows how the vitality of the new physics combats the alienation and fragmentation of twentieth-century life, and replaces it with a model of reality in which the universe itself may possess a type of consciousness, of which human consciousness is one expression.</p></p><p><strong>Danah Zohar</strong>, an American-born physicist and philosopher, teaches at Oxford Brookes University in England and lectures throughout the world. With Ian Marshall, Zohar co-authored the highly-acclaimed <em>The Quantum Self</em> and <em>The Quantum Society.</em>The authors of this heady discourse seek nothing less than a physics of human consciousness grounded in quantum mechanics. British philosopher Zohar and her husband, Marshall, a psychiatrist, argue that consciouness arises through the interaction of the fundamental building-blocks of mind (photons, virtual photons) and of matter (electrons, protons, neutrons). Out of the "correlated jiggling of molecules in neuron cell walls" (i.e., Bose-Einstein condensates), a human self emerges that is integrally linked to other selves, much as two particles, though light-years apart, may interact. Quantum physics, more than a metaphor, is used here as an explanatory tool, a means to help us go beyond the isolation and narcissism of modern culture. The authors take a perilous speculative leap from a recognition of the creativity built into all living systems to "our selves as co-authors of the world."

He saves for years, but first his niece, who narrates the story, needs an operation, and then the bank in which his money is kept fails. The man's spirit never flags, however, and he finally starts his own business at age 79. Sarah Jean, whose life was saved by her uncle's generosity, is by this time a middle-aged adult, and shares in his pleasure. Mitchell's text is eloquent in its simplicity. Straightforward, declarative sentences explain such concepts as segregation and sharecropping without emotional overtones, while her subdued prose makes readers keenly aware of the injustice of segregation. Through Sarah Jean's eyes, readers see both the poverty and discrimination endured and the sense of community and caring shared by her family and friends. Ransome's richly textured oil paintings, uncluttered and direct, beautifully complement the text. These are strong characters captured with forceful brush strokes, yet the illustrations also include such details as a crocheted saddle blanket. Both touching and inspirational, this book is ideal for story hours featuring favorite relatives, and it could start children saving for their own dreams.<br><i>Louise L. Sherman, Anna C.

A HANDBOOK OF DISAPPOINTED FATE highlights a decade of Anne Boyer&#39;s interrogative writing on poetry, death, love, lambs, and other impossible questions.</p><p>Anne Boyer is a poet who lives in Kansas.

Children of survivors and their contemporaries inherit catastrophic histories not through direct recollection but through haunting postmemories&#x2014;multiply mediated images, objects, stories, behaviors, and affects passed down within the family and the culture at large. <br><br>In these new and revised critical readings of the literary and visual legacies of the Holocaust and other, related sites of memory, Marianne Hirsch builds on her influential concept of postmemory. The book's chapters, two of which were written collaboratively with the historian Leo Spitzer, engage the work of postgeneration artists and writers such as Art Spiegelman, W.G. Sebald, Eva Hoffman, Tatana Kellner, Muriel Hasbun, Anne Karpff, Lily Brett, Lorie Novak, David Levinthal, Nancy Spero and Susan Meiselas. Grappling with the ethics of empathy and identification, these artists attempt to forge a creative postmemorial aesthetic that reanimates the past without appropriating it. In her analyses of their fractured texts, Hirsch locates the roots of the familial and affiliative practices of postmemory in feminism and other movements for social change. Using feminist critical strategies to connect past and present, words and images, and memory and gender, she brings the entangled strands of disparate traumatic histories into more intimate contact. With more than fifty illustrations, her text enables a multifaceted encounter with foundational and cutting edge theories in memory, trauma, gender, and visual culture, eliciting a new understanding of history and our place in it.</p><p>Marianne Hirsch is a professor of comparative literature and gender studies at Columbia University. Her most recent books are, with Leo Spitzer, <i>Ghosts of Home: The Afterlife of Czernowitz in Jewish Memory</i> and, with Nancy K. Miller, <i>Rites of Return: Diaspora Poetics and the Politics of Memory</i>. Two of this book's chapters were written with <b>Leo Spitzer</b>, who is also the author of <i>Hotel Bolivia: The Culture of Memory in a Refuge from Nazism</i> and <i>Lives in Between: Assimilation and Marginality in Austria, Brazil, and West Africa, 1780&#x2013;1945</i>.Marianne Hirsch's writings provide us with a varied and complex vocabulary for thinking and writing about the long intergenerational legacy of the Holocaust. Her supple writing wrestles with ghosts, images, shadows, survival, loss and all that we project onto the empty canvas of the aftermath. Moving, urgent, and necessary, this book opens up new ways of thinking about family, relationality, kinship, inheritance, and survival in the wake of cataclysmic violence. (Judith Halberstam, author of <i>The Queer Art of Failure</i>)<br><br>Marianne Hirsch explores the aftermath of genocide as few scholars have. She is both a brilliant reader of texts (photographs, artifacts, literature, and digital images) and an incisive theorist. As she clarifies the fractured forms of post-Holocaust art and literature, she demonstrates the value of imagination as restorative and as rich and layered in its inter-generational complexities. A groundbreaking book that has broad meaning for the study of traumatic memory and its creative aftermath. (Peter Balakian, author of <i>Black Dog of Fate: An American Son Uncovers His Armenian Past</i>)<br><br>With her crucial distinction between 'familial' and 'affiliative' postmemory, Marianne Hirsch shows how the transmission of traumatic experiences occurs not only within families but also across a much wider social field. Her emphasis on the role of gender in this mediating process is illuminating. <i>The Generation of Postmemory</i> will be a major reference in Holocaust and genocide studies for years to come. (Susan Rubin Suleiman, author of <i>Crises of Memory and the Second World War</i>)<br><br><i>The Generation of Postmemory</i> is Marianne Hirsch's finest and fullest description of her paradigm-changing concept of postmemory. In dialogue with a dazzling array of writers and photographers as well as scholars across the humanities, it shows how the 'hinge generations' that have directly experienced or inherited the traumas of the holocaust and other twentieth-century genocides have sought to conceive and commemorate those staggering losses in the hope of a better future. It also traces Hirsch's own dialectical development as a literary, feminist, visual culture, and Holocaust studies scholar, an intellectual trajectory that she shares with many of the best critics of our time. This book is indispensable. (Laura Wexler, author of <i>Tender Violence: Domestic Visions in an Age of U.S. Imperialism</i>)<br><br>And this is precisely where the heuristic value of postmemory comes in: it forces us to question, to mobilize the punctum that launches the relationship between history (with a capital H, of course) and memory, and its artistic representations...

In 1952, the first two serials were published as a book entitled Lehi in the Desert and the World of the Jaredites. That volume has enjoyed wide circulation for thirty-five years. In the present volume, the work of the editors has been confined largely to technical tasks. The earlier texts remain substantially unchanged, but they have been edited lightly. All the information found in &#34;The Book of Mormon as a Mirror of the East&#34; has been worked into the text and notes of &#34;Lehi in the Desert.&#34; In addition, the series &#34;There Were Jaredites&#34; is included here for the first time, and all footnotes in this enlarged edition have been verified and made more readable. The kinds of ancient Near Eastern facts and observations Dr. Nibley correlates with details in the Book of Mormon are drawn from areas of language and literature, archaeology and history, culture and politics. Taken alone, few single factors are overwhelming impressive, but all together they fit very convincingly into what Dr. Nibley calls &#34;The Big Picture.&#34; As he writes at the conclusion of his findings: &#34;There is no point at all to the question: Who wrote the Book of Mormon? It would have been quite as impossible for the most learned man alive in 1830 as it was for Joseph Smith.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Very Crazy, G.I.!: Strange but True Stories of the Vietnam War</h2><p>AMERICAN BOYS AT WAR IN VIETNAM--AND INVOLVED IN INCIDENTS YOU WON'T FIND IN THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES<br><br>In this compelling, highly unusual collection of amazing but true stories, U.S. soldiers reveal fantastic, almost unbelievable events that occurred in places ranging from the deadly Central Highlands to the Cong-infested Mekong Delta.<br><br>"Finders Keepers" became the sacred byword for one exhausted recon team who stumbled upon a fortune worth more than $500,000--and managed, with a little American ingenuity, to relocate the bounty to the States.

At least, at times, it felt that<br>way. The base camp at Dong Ha seemed to be one of their favorite target<br>areas and, too, maybe one of their easiest. Dong Ha was located on<br>Highway 9, less than ten miles from the DMZ in the I Corps Military<br>Region, the northernmost of the four corps tactical zones into which<br>Vietnam was divided. The DMZ was the infamous and misnamed Demilitarized<br>Zone that separated North Vietnam from South Vietnam, and it was<br>anything but demilitarized. The North Vietnamese Army used it as a<br>springboard for attacks in I Corps, and since their rocket artillery<br>rounds could easily cover the distance, Dong Ha was not only a target of<br>choice for the NVA artillery gunners but a target of opportunity as<br>well.<br><br>This time, they were walking the Russian 122mm rockets into the base<br>with such precision that even the uninitiated could see it wasn't a<br>random attack. The deafening explosions of the forty-pound warheads<br>erupted in an evident pattern as specific sites were being targeted.<br>With their vast spy network throughout the re-gion, the Communist<br>gunners knew the Marine facility well and took full advantage of the<br>knowledge.<br><br>However, even before the first rocket slammed into the tents or<br>tin-roofed barracks hootches, and split sec-onds before the base camp's<br>warning siren began build-ing into a screaming wail, Sgt. James P.<br>Henderson recognized their distinctive whoosh, like a truck's tires at<br>high speed on a wet road, for what it was and yelled at his people to<br>get to the protective sandbagged bunkers outside.<br><br>"Incoming!" the wiry noncommissioned officer yelled, pulling Marines out<br>of the barracks and shoving them toward the nearest bunker, just around<br>the corner of the hootch. "Go! Go! Go!"<br><br>The rockets were falling in rapid succession, dancing across the base in<br>deadly, macabre steps. Whoomphs fol-lowed the screaming whooshes and the<br>thundering roars of secondary explosions that told of direct hits. Hot<br>shrapnel rained across the camp, ripping and tearing through anything<br>and anyone in its way.<br><br>Rising black plumes and the acrid, oily odor of burn-ing fuel confirmed<br>the NVA gunners' accuracy. Since the bases and camps were stationary,<br>the ranges had long been defined and plotted by the Viet Cong and NVA.<br>Be-sides, they'd had years of practice.<br><br>Another 122mm rocket slammed into the next hootch over, tearing through<br>the sheet-metal roofing and gutting the wood-frame building.<br><br>Someone was screaming for a corpsman, then the call was drowned out by<br>still another series of whoomphs and explosions. The impacts and<br>detonations sent tremors across the base.<br><br>His rifle in hand, Henderson grabbed his flak jacket and steel-pot<br>helmet and took off in a dead run, follow-ing the others. If a ground<br>attack followed, he would damn well be ready. The North Vietnamese Army<br>some-times attempted a ground assault after a shelling, hoping that the<br>Americans' defenses had been weakened or were inadequately manned.<br><br>Henderson had just turned the corner of his hootch and was within a few<br>feet of the bunker's opening when a rocket exploded a few yards behind<br>him. The blast slammed into his back, and the intense heat, splintered<br>metal, and concussion lifted him up off the ground forcefully and threw<br>him down limply like a discarded doll.<br><br>The pain was intense and overwhelming, and when Henderson tried to lift<br>himself up and turn over, his arms and legs wouldn't respond. They<br>couldn't. There was too much weight on his legs and back. Lying facedown<br>in the hard-packed orange earth, he wondered what had fallen on top of<br>him. Building debris, most likely. But why was it so heavy?<br><br>His breaths were shallow, and he was soon struggling for air, fighting a<br>dark current that threatened to sweep up and overpower him. His chest<br>burned, and the air that somehow squeezed through to his lungs only<br>fanned his pain. In the distance, someone was yelling for a corpsman,<br>but the voice seemed too far away to matter. He knew he was hurt, but he<br>couldn't determine how badly. What was on his back?<br><br>He couldn't see any debris, but then he couldn't focus either; every<br>time he opened his eyes, a searing light burned through his sockets. It<br>was too bright and blind-ing to let anything else in. Then, in an<br>instant, the light began to fade, and a shadowy world took its place<br>around him. He was fading into black.<br><br>Most of his hearing was lost, and what sound filtered through was<br>muffled by the blood he could feel flowing from his ears. He would learn<br>later that his eardrums were shattered. Between the shaking from the<br>follow-up explosions and the cool shuddering earth, he could feel the<br>burning pain of his broken body.<br><br>Something was flowing down the side of his face and spilling into his<br>mouth. The droplets tasted like warm copper droplets, and memory<br>recognized it instantly. It was blood. He wanted to spit it out but<br>couldn't even find the strength to do that. Instead, he managed to use<br>his tongue to push it through his lips, and it dribbled to the ground.<br>He could feel it pool in the soil beneath his cheek.<br><br>When he tried to call for help nothing came out. The shallow exhaled<br>breaths didn't allow words, and in a terrible, frightening instant, he<br>understood his fate. He was dying.<br><br>Panic began to take over, but it was too late for that, too. The shadows<br>grew darker, and the pain lessened, drifting off, actually leaving him<br>in the cold tide of dark-ness.<br><br>All around him, the rain of rockets fell, then finally danced off to<br>another part of the base. Through the earth, he felt their rumble<br>diminish, moving away in big, labored steps.<br><br>Moments later, it was still. Too still.<br><br>For what seemed like an eternity, there was nothing for Henderson. No<br>sudden rush of life's reruns or re-grets. Nothing but white noise and an<br>internal pounding that replaced the exploding artillery rounds. The<br>inter-nal pounding was his pulse, and he could sense that the beats were<br>lessening.<br><br>Then he still couldn't see, but he could feel someone at his side gently<br>turning him over, and he heard a yell, "Over here! Head wound!" The<br>Marine sergeant could barely hear the other wounded and dying Marines<br>cry-ing around him, but that was enough to bring back the panic.<br><br>"I can't get a pulse! Don't die on me, you son of a bitch!" he heard<br>that someone say as though in the dis-tance, and although Henderson<br>couldn't see the Marine shaking his head wearily or see the man's<br>blood-drenched hands, he could sense what was happening next as the man<br>lowered him back to the ground. "Ah, Christ!" the man said, distant and<br>faint.<br><br>"Don't go! I'm not dead!" Henderson yelled in his mind, only no one else<br>could hear. The back of his head was broken open where rocket shrapnel<br>had pushed his steel pot back into his skull like a baseball shattering<br>a window.<br><br>James P. Henderson's world and life were bleeding away, swirling<br>steadily toward a small opening of light propped against a dark sea<br>backdrop. He was being sucked into a whirlpool, and he fought it until<br>there was no choice but to spiral with it; he didn't have the strength,<br>and he realized it with a reluctant acceptance.

In perhaps her most significant work, <i>Hegel Contra Sociology</i>, Rose mounts a forceful defence of Hegelian speculative thought. Demonstrating how, in his criticisms of Kant and Fichte, Hegel supplies a preemptive critique of Weber, Durkheim, and all of the sociological traditions that stem from these &#x201c;neo-Kantian&#x201d; thinkers, Rose argues that any attempt to preserve Marxism from a similar critique and any attempt to renew sociology cannot succeed without coming to terms with Hegel&#x2019;s own speculative discourse. With an analysis of Hegel&#x2019;s mature works in light of his early radical writings, this book represents a profound step toward enacting just such a return to the Hegelian.</p><p><b>Gillian Rose</b> was a British philosopher and sociologist.

This Vintage Original edition marks its first appearance in the United States.<br><br>On a rainy night in the 1930s, Anne Louvet appears at the run-down Hotel du Lion d'Or in the village of Janvilliers.&nbsp;&nbsp;She is seeking a job and a new life, one far removed from the awful injustices of her past. As Anne embarks on a torrential love affair with a married veteran of the Great War, <b>The Girl at the Lion d'Or</b> fashions an unbreakable spell of narrative and atmosphere that evokes French masters from Flaubert to Renoir.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>"This moving and profound novel is perfectly constructed, and admirable in its configurations of place and period."--<i>The Times</i> (London)<br><br>"I would urge those who appreciated--<b>The French Lieutenant's Woman</b> to try this one--. They may well think it superior."--<i>Sunday Telegraph</i> (London)</p><p>At the outset of Sebastian Faulks's <i>The Girl at the Lion d'Or</i>, lovely, abandoned Anne Louvet seems almost willing to retreat into the anonymous routines of her waitressing duties--until she meets Charles Hartmann. He, trapped in a loveless marriage and feeling increasingly adrift more than a decade after serving in the Great War, is as enchanted by Anne's vulnerability as she is by his tender, almost paternal attentions. Their affair, and the cruel paradox of seeking a clandestine sufficiency, allow Faulks to pit the demands of desire against the necessities of duty, a task he pursues with tireless charm.<p> When Anne first arrives at the Hotel du Lion d'Or in the French town of Janvilliers, it is with the dual hope of escaping an unhappy past and discovering some degree of happiness. Undeniably beautiful and just bold enough to prod her own fate, she sees in the wealthy and restless Hartmann a soul that might redeem her own. "How was it possible, she wondered, to be awed by someone and yet to feel protective towards him too?" For his part, Hartmann senses in her the woman who, finally, might satisfy his need to offer refuge.</p><p> The secret of Anne's past, which she fears will drive Hartmann from her, conspires along with his gnawing uncertainty about her ultimate contentment to place their romance at a crossroads. Faulks, with deft restraint, never allows matters to lapse into the maudlin. Assessing the apparent inappropriateness of his love for Anne, Hartmann reflects that "there was something wrong ... in a society that could think of such generous feelings as unacceptable." Faulks's own generosity illuminates each page. <i>--Ben Guterson</i></p>Sebastian Faulks is best known for his trilogy of novels set in France: <b>The Girl at the Lion d&#x2019;Or, Birdsong</b>, and <b>Charlotte Gray</b>, the latter two of which were bestsellers.

Which Interpretation?: Philosophical Hermeneutics for the Church (The Church and Postmodern Culture)</h2><p>In this volume, renowned philosopher Merold Westphal introduces current philosophical thinking related to interpreting the Bible. Recognizing that no theology is completely free of philosophical &#34;contamination,&#34; he engages and mines contemporary hermeneutical theory in service of the church. After providing a historical overview of contemporary theories of interpretation, Westphal addresses postmodern hermeneutical theory, arguing that the relativity embraced there is not the same as the relativism in which &#34;anything goes.&#34; Rather, Westphal encourages us to embrace the proliferation of interpretations based on different perspectives as a way to get at the richness of the biblical text.</p><p>In this compelling volume, renowned philosopher Merold Westphal introduces current philosophical thinking related to interpreting the Bible. Recognizing that no theology is completely free of philosophical "contamination," Westphal engages and mines contemporary hermeneutical theory in service of the church. He encourages readers to embrace the proliferation of interpretations based on different perspectives as a way to get at the richness of the biblical text.<br><br>"Merold Westphal is a clear, insightful, and astute interpreter of philosophers for Christian understanding and of Christianity for philosophical understanding. A faithful and learned churchman, Westphal here mines his deep philosophical learning but wears it lightly, enabling beginners to access important insights while inviting others to probe significant issues. This book deserves a wide readership."--<b>L. Gregory Jones</b>, dean of the Divinity School and professor of theology, Duke University<br><br>"Westphal deftly navigates between hermeneutical despair and hermeneutical arrogance to arrive at a hermeneutic that affirms the vital importance of interpretation and yet insists that Scripture itself truly speaks. The result is not only a judicious and correct theory of interpretation but also a striking demonstration of what such a humble and respectful hermeneutic looks like in practice."--<b>Bruce Ellis Benson</b>, professor and chair of the philosophy department, Wheaton College<br><br>"In this beautiful little book, Merold Westphal brings to bear on the interpretation of Scripture his life-long interest in hermeneutics. With his customary clarity of analysis and style, the author debunks the common equation of interpretation with relativism, showing theologians, pastors, and laypeople what the church can learn from philosophical hermeneutics about reading and performing God's word. Besides showing how 'Athens can be helpful to Jerusalem,' this book provides an excellent introduction to Gadamer's hermeneutics and to the most-central issues and thinkers surrounding interpretation theory, including the important aspects of community and politics. This book is a gift not only to the church but also to anyone looking for a clear and thoughtful introduction to contemporary interpretation theory."--<b>Jens Zimmermann</b>, professor of English and Canada Research Chair for Interpretation, Religion, and Culture, Trinity Western University<b>Merold Westphal</b> (PhD, Yale University) is distinguished professor of philosophy at Fordham University in Bronx, New York, where he has taught for more than twenty years.

But to its half a million residents, it&#x2019;s their last resort.</b></p><p>Situated hundreds of miles from any other settlement, deep within the inhospitable desert of northern Kenya where only thorn bushes grow, Dadaab is a city like no other. Its buildings are made from mud, sticks, or plastic. Its entire economy is grey. And its citizens survive on rations and luck. Over the course of four years, Ben Rawlence became a firsthand witness to a strange and desperate place, getting to know many of those who had come seeking sanctuary. Among them are Guled, a former child soldier who lives for football; Nisho, who scrapes an existence by pushing a wheelbarrow and dreaming of riches; Tawane, the indomitable youth leader; and Kheyro, a student whose future hangs upon her education.</p><p>In <i>City of Thorns</i>, Rawlence interweaves the stories of nine individuals to show what life is like in the camp, sketching the wider political forces that keep the refugees trapped.

And it is more than that. At a time when newspapers are filled with daily images of refugees arriving in boats on Europe&#x2019;s shores, when politicians and governments grapple with solutions to migration and erect ever larger walls and fences, it is an important reminder that a vast majority of the world&#x2019;s refugees never get as far as a boat or a border of the developed world.&#x201d;&#x2015;Caroline Moorehead, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;The most absorbing book in recent memory about life in a refugee camp....Mr. Rawlence&#x2019;s major feat is stripping away the anonymity....He transforms its denizens from faceless victims into three-dimensional human beings.

In his lifetime, aficionados and detractors both labeled Schulz as a fundamentalist Christian or as an atheist. Yet his deeply personal views on faith have eluded journalists and biographers for decades. Previously unpublished writings from Schulz will move fans as they begin to see the nuances of the humorist's own complex, intense journey toward understanding God and faith.</p><p>"There are three things that I've learned never to discuss with people," Linus says, "Religion, politics, and the Great Pumpkin." Yet with the support of religious communities, Schulz bravely defied convention and dared to express spiritual thought in the "funny pages," a secular, mainstream entertainment medium. This insightful, thorough study of the 17,897 <i>Peanuts</i> newspaper strips, seventy-five animated titles, and global merchandising empire will delight and intrigue as Schulz considers what it means to believe, what it means to doubt, and what it means to share faith with the world.</p></p><p>The first spiritual biography of a misunderstood believer, the renowned creator of <i>Peanuts</i><br><br>Throughout my entire life, I have seen my dad's faith in action. I love that the world will now have a book testifying of Dad's interest in the life of Jesus Christ. Stephen Lind's book, <i>A Charlie Brown Religion</i>, will lead you through Dad's life of faith and love for the Scriptures. Who is Jesus to Charles M. Schulz? After reading this book, you will know. (Amy Schulz Johnson, daughter of Charles M. Schulz)<br><br>I don't think anyone has written about my dad and truly captured the essence of his character as completely and thoroughly as Stephen Lind has in this book. His research is commendable and his ability to stay away from 'judgment' and just present the facts in an engaging and sensitive way allowed who my dad was to shine through with brilliance. (Meredith Schulz Hodges, daughter of Charles M. Schulz)<br><br>Schulz's views on religion, the manner in which religion functions within the strip itself, and Schulz's widely publicized crisis of faith are important and widely discussed topics that deserve exactly the sort of serious and well-informed treatment found in this book. Schulz is one of the most important American comics creators, but surprisingly little has been written on him. This is an impressive and welcome contribution to comics studies and in particular to the study of Charles M. Schulz and his beloved <i>Peanuts</i>. The book is very well researched, and it clears up numerous confusions with respect to Schulz's religious views and how they interacted with his important artistic work. (Roy T.

For years, he lived&nbsp;&nbsp;among outlaws, surviving by wit and&nbsp;&nbsp;sleight-of-hand. Now, wielding the powerful, magic absorbing&nbsp;&nbsp;Darksword, Joram retums to the enchanted Kingdom that&nbsp;&nbsp;once was his home to win revenge and claim his&nbsp;&nbsp;birthright. Here he will test Bishop Vanya and his&nbsp;&nbsp;fierce army of Duuk-tsarith in a battle unlike any&nbsp;&nbsp;their world has known. Joined by the scholarly catalyst Saryon, the young mage Mosiah, and the&nbsp;&nbsp;trickster Simkin, Jorma confronts the shattering&nbsp;&nbsp;secret of his past and discovers the ancient prophecy&nbsp;&nbsp;that puts the fate of the world in his hands--the hands that forged the Darksword.</p><p>The Summons<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Saryon....&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The catalyst floated between unconsciousness and the waking nightmare of his life.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Holiness, forgive me!&#x201d; he muttered feverishly. &#x201c;Take me back to our sanctuary! Free me of this terrible burden. I cannot bear it!&#x201d; Tossing on his crude bed, Saryon put his hands over his closed eyes as though he could blot out the dreadful visions that sleep only intensified and made more frightening. &#x201c;Murder!&#x201d; he cried. &#x201c;I have done murder! Not once! Oh, no, Holiness! Twice. Two men have died because of me!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Saryon!&#x201d; The voice repeated the catalyst&#x2019;s name, and there was a hint of irritation in it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The catalyst cringed, digging the palms of his hands into his eyes. &#x201c;Let me confess to you, Holiness!&#x201d; he cried. &#x201c;Punish me as you will. I deserve it, desire it! Then I will be free of their faces, their eyes ... haunting me!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Saryon sat up on his bed, half-asleep. He had not slept in days; exhaustion and excitement had temporarily overthrown his mind. He had no conscious thought of where he was or why this voice &#x2014; that he knew to be hundreds of miles away &#x2014; should be speaking to him so clearly. &#x201c;The first, a young man of our Order,&#x201d; the catalyst continued brokenly. &#x201c;The warlock used my Life-giving force to murder him. The wretched catalyst never had a chance. And now the warlock, too, is dead! He lay before me helpless, drained of his magic by my arts! Joram &#x2014;&#x201d; The catalyst&#x2019;s voice sank to a hushed whisper. &#x201c;Joram....&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Saryon!&#x201d; The voice was stern, urgent and commanding, and it finally roused the catalyst from his confused exhaustion.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d; Shivering in his wet robes, Saryon looked around. He was not in the sanctuary of the Font. He was in a chill prison cell. Death surrounded him. Brick walls &#x2014; stone made by the hands of man, not shaped by magic. The wood-beam ceiling above bore the gouges of tools. Cold metal bars forged by the hand of the Dark Arts seemed a barrier against Life itself. &#x201c;Joram?&#x201d; Saryon called softly through teeth clenched against the cold.<br> &nbsp;<br> But a glance told him the young man was not in the prison cell, his bed had not been slept in.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; Saryon said to himself, shuddering. Joram was in the wilderness, disposing of the body.... But then, whose had been the voice he heard so clearly?<br> &nbsp;<br> The catalyst&#x2019;s head sank into his shaking hands. &#x201c;Take my life, Almin!&#x201d; he prayed fervently. &#x201c;If you truly do exist, take my life and end this torment, this misery. For now I am going mad &#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Saryon! You cannot avoid me, if such is your intent! You will listen to me! You have no choice!&#x201d;<br> The catalyst raised his head, his eyes wide and staring, his body convulsing with a chill that was colder than the breath of the bitterest winter wind. &#x201c;Holiness?&#x201d; he called through trembling lips. Rising stiffly to his feet, the catalyst looked around the small cell. &#x201c;Holiness? Where are you? I can&#x2019;t see you, yet I hear &#x2014; I don&#x2019;t understand ...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am present in your mind, Saryon,&#x201d; the voice said. &#x201c;I speak to you from the Font. How I am able to accomplish this need be of little importance to you, Father. My powers are very great. Are you alone?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Y-yes, Holiness, for the moment. But I &#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Organize your thoughts, Saryon!&#x201d; The voice sounded impatient again. &#x201c;They are such a jumble I cannot read them! You need not speak. Think the words you say and I will hear them. I will give you a moment to calm yourself with prayer, then I expect you to be ready to attend me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The voice fell silent. Saryon was still conscious of its presence inside his head, buzzing like an insect in his mind. Hurriedly he sought to compose himself, but it was not with prayer. Though he had begged only moments before that the Almin take his life &#x2014; and though he had sincerely meant that despairing plea &#x2014; Saryon felt a primal urge for self-survival well up inside him. The very fact that Bishop Vanya was able to invade his mind like this appalled him and filled him with anger &#x2014; though he knew that the anger was wrong. As a humble catalyst, he should be proud, he supposed, that the great Bishop would spare time to investigate his unworthy thoughts. But deep within, from that same dark place whence had come his nightdreams, a voice asked coldly, How much does he know? Is there any way I can hide from him?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Holiness,&#x201d; said Saryon hesitantly, turning around in the center of the dark room, staring fearfully about him as though the Bishop might at any moment step out of the brick wall, &#x201c;I ... find it difficult to compose my ... thoughts. My inquisitive mind &#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The same inquisitive mind that has led you to walk dark paths?&#x201d; the Bishop asked in displeasure.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, Holiness,&#x201d; Saryon replied humbly. &#x201c;I admit this is my weakness, but it prevents me attending to your words without knowing how and by what means we are communicating. I &#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your thoughts are in turmoil! We can accomplish nothing useful this way. Very well.&#x201d; Bishop Vanya&#x2019;s voice, echoing in Saryon&#x2019;s mind, sounded angry, if resigned. &#x201c;It is necessary, Father, that as spiritual leader of our people, I keep in contact with the far-flung reaches of this world. As you know, there are those out there who seek to reduce our Order to little more than what we were in the ancient days &#x2014; familiars who served our masters in the form of animals. Because of this threat, it is necessary that many of my communications with others &#x2014; both of our Order and those who are helping to preserve it &#x2014; must be on a confidential basis.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, Holiness,&#x201d; Saryon murmured nervously. The dark night beyond the cell&#x2019;s barred window was thinning into gray dawn. He could hear a few footsteps in the streets &#x2014; those who began their workday the same time as the sun began his. But otherwise the village slept. Where was Joram? Had he been caught, the body discovered? The catalyst clasped his hands together and attempted to concentrate on the Bishops voice.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Through magical means, Saryon, a chamber was devised for the Bishop of the Realm whereby he can minister in private to his followers in need of support. Known as the Chamber of Discretion, it is particularly useful for communicating with those performing certain delicate tasks that must be kept secret for the good of the people &#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A network of spies! Saryon thought before he could stop himself. The Church, the Order to which he had devoted his life, was in reality nothing more than a giant spider, sitting in the midst of a vast web, attuned to every movement of those caught within its sticky grasp! It was a dreadful thought, and Saryon tried instantly to banish it.<br> &nbsp;<br> He began to sweat again, even as his body shivered. Cringing, he waited for the Bishop to read his mind and reprimand him. But Vanya continued on as though he had not heard, expounding upon the Chamber of Discretion and how it worked, allowing one mind to speak to another through magical means.<br> &nbsp;<br> So tense that his jaw muscles ached from the strain of clenching his teeth, Saryon pondered. &#x201c;The Bishop did not notice my random thoughts!&#x201d; he said to himself. &#x201c;Perhaps, as he said, I have to concentrate to make myself heard. If so &#x2014; and if I can control my mind &#x2014; I might be able to cope with this mental invasion.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As Saryon realized this, it occurred to him that he was hearing only those thoughts Vanya wanted him to hear. He wasn&#x2019;t able to penetrate beyond whatever barriers the Bishop himself had established. Slowly, Saryon began to relax. He waited until his superior had reached an end.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I understand, Holiness,&#x201d; the catalyst thought, concentrating all his effort on his words.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Excellent, Father.&#x201d; Vanya appeared pleased. There was a pause; the Bishop was carefully considering and concentrating on his next words. But when he spoke &#x2014; or when his thoughts took form in Saryon&#x2019;s mind &#x2014; they were rapid and concise, as though being repeated by rote. &#x201c;I sent you on a dangerous task, Saryon &#x2014; that of attempting to apprehend the young man called Joram. Because of the danger, I grew concerned about your welfare when I did not hear from you. Therefore, I deemed it best to contact a trusted associate of mine concerning you &#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Simkin!&#x201d; Saryon thought before he could stop himself. So intense was the image of the young man in his mind that it must have translated to the Bishop.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d; Thrown off in the middle of his speech, Vanya appeared confused.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; Saryon muttered hastily. &#x201c;I apologize, Holiness. My thoughts were disturbed by ... by something occurring outside....&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I suggest you remove yourself from the window, Father,&#x201d; the Bishop said ascerbically.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, Holiness,&#x201d; Saryon replied, digging his nails into the flesh of his palms, using the stimulus of pain to help him concentrate.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was a second&#x2019;s pause again &#x2014; Vanya attempting to remember where he was? Why didn&#x2019;t he just write it down? Saryon wondered irritably, sensing the Bishop&#x2019;s thoughts turned from him. Then the voice was back. This time, it was filled with concern.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Quinn Brothers (Chesapeake Bay Saga)</h2><p><b>#1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Nora Roberts presents the first two novels in a captivating saga about the lives and loves of four brothers on the windswept shores of the Chesapeake Bay.<br><br><i>Sea Swept<br><br></i></b>A champion boat racer, Cameron Quinn travels the world spending his winnings on champagne and women.

Swirling eddies spiraled until one of them ignited&#x2014;a newborn star.<br> &nbsp;<br> The virgin sun wore whirling skirts of dust and electricity. Gas and rocks and bits of this and that fell into those pleats, gathering in dim lumps&nbsp;...&nbsp;planets&nbsp;...<br> &nbsp;<br> One tiny worldlet circled at a middle distance. It had a modest set of properties:<br> &nbsp;<br> mass&#x2014;barely enough to draw in a passing asteroid or two;<br> &nbsp;<br> moons&#x2014;one, the remnant of a savage collision, but big enough to tug deep tides;<br> &nbsp;<br> spin&#x2014;to set winds churning through a fuming atmosphere;<br> &nbsp;<br> density&#x2014;a brew that mixed and separated, producing an unpromising surface slag;<br> &nbsp;<br> temperature&#x2014;heat was the planet&#x2019;s only voice, a weak one, swamped by the blaring sun. Anyway, what can a planet tell the universe, in a reedy cry of infrared? &#x201c;This exists,&#x201d; it repeated, over and over. &#x201c;This is a condensed stone, radiating at about three hundred degrees, insignificant on the scale of stars.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This speck, a mote, exists.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A simple statement to an indifferent cosmos&#x2014;the signature of a rocky world, tainted by salty, smoke-blown puddles.<br> &nbsp;<br> But then something new stirred in those puddles. It was a triviality&#x2014;a mere discoloration here and there. But from that moment the voice changed. Subtly, shifting in timbre, still faint and indistinct, it nevertheless seemed now to say,<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&nbsp;...&nbsp;am&nbsp;...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> � CORE<br> &nbsp;<br> An angry deity glowered at Alex. Slanting sunshine cast shadows across the incised cheeks and outthrust tongue of Great Tu, Maori god of war.<br> &nbsp;<br> A dyspeptic idol, Alex thought, contemplating the carved figure. I&#x2019;d feel the same if I were stuck up there, decorating a billionaire&#x2019;s office wall.<br> &nbsp;<br> It occurred to Alex that Great Tu&#x2019;s wooden nose resembled the gnomon of a sundial. Its shadow kept time, creeping to the measured ticking of a twentieth century grandfather clock in the corner. The silhouette stretched slowly, amorously, toward a sparkling amethyst geode&#x2014;yet another of George Hutton&#x2019;s many geological treasures. Alex made a wager with himself, that the shadow wouldn&#x2019;t reach its goal before the sinking sun was cut off by the western hills.<br> &nbsp;<br> And at this rate, neither would George Hutton. Where the devil is the man? Why did he agree to this meeting, if he didn&#x2019;t plan on bloody showing up?<br> &nbsp;<br> Alex checked his watch again, even though he knew the time. He caught himself nervously tapping one shoe against the nearby table leg, and stopped doing it.<br> &nbsp;<br> What have Jen and Stan always told you? &#x201c;Try to learn patience, Alex.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t his best-known virtue. But then, he&#x2019;d learned a lot the last few months. Remarkable how it focused your mind, when you guarded a secret that might mean the end of the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> He glanced toward his friend and former mentor, Stan Goldman, who had set up this appointment with the chairman of Tangoparu Ltd. Apparently unperturbed by his employer&#x2019;s tardiness, the slender, aging theoretician was immersed in the latest issue of Physical Review.<br> &nbsp;<br> No hope for distraction there. Alex sighed and let his eyes rove George Hutton&#x2019;s office one more time, hoping to get a measure of the man.<br> &nbsp;<br> Of course the conference table was equipped with the best and latest plaques, for accessing the World Data Net. One entire wall was taken up by an active-events screen, a montage of real-time views from random locations across the Earth&#x2014;zeppelins cruising above Wuhan&nbsp;...&nbsp;sunrise in a North African village&nbsp;...&nbsp;the urban lights of any city in the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> Original holographic sculptures of mythical beasts shimmered by the entrance to the suite, but nearest the desk were Hutton&#x2019;s dearest treasures, minerals and ores collected over a lifetime grubbing through the planet&#x2019;s crust&#x2014;including a huge blood zircon, glittering on a pedestal just below the Maori war mask. It struck Alex that both objects were products of fiery crucibles&#x2014;one mineral, the other social. Each denoted resilience under pressure. Perhaps this said something about George Hutton&#x2019;s personality, as well.<br> &nbsp;<br> But then, perhaps it meant nothing at all. Alex had never been a great judge of people. Witness the events of the last year.<br> &nbsp;<br> With a sudden click and hum, the hallway doors parted and a tall, brown man appeared, breathing hard and coated with perspiration.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ah! You made yourselves at home. Good. Sorry to keep you waiting, Stan. Dr. Lustig. Excuse me, will you? I&#x2019;ll only be a moment.&#x201d; He peeled a sweaty jersey off broad shoulders, striding past a window overlooking the sailboats of Auckland harbor.<br> &nbsp;<br> George Hutton, I presume, Alex thought as he lowered his outstretched hand and sat back down. Not much for formality. That&#x2019;s just as well, I suppose.<br> &nbsp;<br> From the open door to the lavatory, Hutton shouted. &#x201c;Our game had delay after delay for injuries! Minor stuff, fortunately. But I&#x2019;m sure you understand, I couldn&#x2019;t let the Tangoparu team down when I was needed. Not during the finals against Nippon Electric!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Normally, it might seem odd for a businessman in his fifties to neglect appointments for a rugby game. But the dusky giant toweling himself off in the loo seemed completely unselfconscious, aglow with victory. Alex glanced at his former teacher, who now worked for Hutton here in New Zealand. Stan only shrugged, as if to say billionaires made their own rules.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hutton emerged wearing a dressing gown and drying his hair with a terry-cloth towel. &#x201c;Can I offer you anything, Dr. Lustig? How about you, Stan?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nothing, thank you,&#x201d; Alex said. Less reticent, Stan accepted a Glenfiddich and spring water. Then Hutton settled into a plush swivel chair, stretching his long legs beside the kauri-wood table.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whatever happens, Alex knew, this is where the trail ends. This is my last hope.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Maori engineer-businessman regarded him with piercing brown eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m told you want to discuss the Iquitos incident, Dr. Lustig. And the miniature black hole you let slip out of your hands there. Frankly, I thought you&#x2019;d be sick of that embarrassment by now. What did some press hacks call it then? A possible China Syndrome?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Stan cut in. &#x201c;A few sensationalists set off a five-minute panic on the World Net, until the scientific community showed everybody that tiny singularities like Alex&#x2019;s dissipate harmlessly. They&#x2019;re too small to last long by themselves.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Hutton raised one dark eyebrow. &#x201c;Is that so, Dr. Lustig?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Alex had faced that question so many times since Iquitos. By now he had countless stock answers&#x2014;from five-second sound bites for the vid cameras to ten-minute lullabies for Senate investigators&nbsp;...&nbsp;all the way to hours of abstruse mathematics to soothe his fellow physicists. He really ought to be used to it by now. Still the question burned, as it had the first time.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Talk to me, Lustig,&#x201d; the reporter, Pedro Manella, had demanded on that ashen afternoon in Peru, as they watched rioting students set Alex&#x2019;s work site ablaze. &#x201c;Tell me that thing you made isn&#x2019;t about to eat its way to China.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lying had become so reflexive since then, it took some effort to break the habit today. &#x201c;Um, what did Stan tell you?&#x201d; he asked George Hutton, whose broad features still glistened under a thin gloss of perspiration.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Only that you claim to have a secret. Something you&#x2019;ve kept from reporters, tribunals&nbsp;...&nbsp;even the security agencies of a dozen nations. In this day and age, that&#x2019;s impressive by itself.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But we Maori people of New Zealand have a saying,&#x201d; he went on. &#x201c;A man who can fool chiefs, and even gods, must still face the monsters he himself created.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Have you created a monster, Dr. Lustig?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The question direct. Alex realized why Hutton reminded him of Pedro Manella on that humid evening in Peru, as tear gas wafted down those debris-strewn streets and canals. Both big men had voices like Hollywood deities. Both were used to getting answers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Manella had pursued Alex onto the creaking hotel balcony to get a good view of the burning power plant. The reporter panned his camera as the main containment building collapsed amid clouds of powdery cement. Cheering students provided a vivid scene for Manella to feed live to his viewers on the Net.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;When the mob cut the power cables, Lustig,&#x201d; the persistent journalist asked while shooting, &#x201c;that let your black hole out of its magnetic cage. It fell into the Earth then, no? So what happens now? Will it emerge again, blazing and incinerating some hapless place halfway around the world?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What did you make here, Lustig? A beast that will devour us all?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Even then, Alex recognized the hidden message between the words. The renowned investigator hadn&#x2019;t been seeking truth; he wanted reassurance.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, of course I didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Alex remembered telling Manella on that day, and everyone else since then. Now he let go of the lie with relief.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, Mr. Hutton. I think I made the very Devil itself.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Stan Goldman&#x2019;s head jerked up. Until this moment, Alex hadn&#x2019;t even confided in his old mentor. Sorry, Stan, he thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> Silence stretched as Hutton stared at him. You&#x2019;re saying&nbsp;...&nbsp;the singularity didn&#x2019;t dissipate like the experts said? That it might still be down there, absorbing matter from the Earth&#x2019;s core?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Alex understood the man&#x2019;s incredulity. Human minds weren&#x2019;t meant to picture something that was smaller than an atom, and yet weighed megatons. Something narrow enough to fall through the densest rock, yet bound to circle the planet&#x2019;s center in a spiraling pavane of gravity. Something ineffably but insatiably hungry, and which grew ever hungrier the more it ate&nbsp;...<br> &nbsp;<br> Just thinking about it put in sudden doubt the very notions of up and down. It challenged faith in the ground below your feet. Alex tried to explain.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The generals showed me their power plant&nbsp;...&nbsp;offered me a blank check to construct its core. So I took their word they&#x2019;d be getting permission soon. Any day now, they kept telling me.&#x201d; Alex shrugged at his former gullibility. An old story, if a bitter one.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Five Chimneys: The Story of Auschwitz</h2><p><p>2019 Reprint of 1947 Edition.&nbsp; Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition software.&nbsp; <em>Five Chimneys</em> is one of the most detailed personal accounts of Auschwitz-Birkenau. &nbsp;Olga was an inmate in the women's barracks at Birkenau for seven months in 1944-1945 and her narrative highlights issues of special importance to women. <em>Five Chimneys</em> is similar to <em>Thanks to My Mother</em> by Schoschana Rabinovici, in the acute powers of observation and memory of the respective authors.</p></p><p></p><h2>Music as an Art</h2><p><p>As Scruton argues in this book, in earlier times, our musical culture had secure foundations in the church, the concert hall and the home; in the ceremonies and celebrations of ordinary life, religion and manners. Yet we no longer live in that world. Fewer people now play instruments and music is, for many, a form of largely solitary enjoyment. As he shows in <i>Music as an Art</i>, we live at a critical time for classical music, and this book is an important contribution to the debate, of which we stand in need, concerning the place of music in Western civilization. </p><p><i>Music as an Art</i> begins by examining music through a philosophical lens, engaging in discussions about tonality, music and the moral life, music and cognitive science and German idealism, as well as recalling the author's struggle to encourage his students to distinguish the qualities of good music. Scruton then explains--via erudite chapters on Schubert, Britten, Rameau, opera and film--how we can develop greater judgement in music, recognizing both good taste and bad, establishing musical values, as well as musical pleasures.</p></p><p><b>Sir Roger Scruton</b> is the author of <i>Understanding Music</i> and <i>The Aesthetics of Music</i> as well as numerous bestselling books of philosophy, history, fiction and criticism. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, a Fellow of the British Academy and an Honorary Bencher of the Inner Temple. He currently teaches an MA course in philosophy for the University of Buckingham.&#x201c;Scruton fastidiously argues for tonality and expression as significant components of musical compositions in this enlightening academic work.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>The Many Faces of Josephine Baker: Dancer, Singer, Activist, Spy (11) (Women of Action)</h2><p><p><b>A complete biographical look at the complex life of a world-famous entertainer</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With determination and audacity, Josephine Baker turned her comic and musical abilities into becoming a worldwide icon of the Jazz Age. <i>The Many Faces of Josephine Baker: Dancer, Singer, Activist, Spy</i> provides the first in-depth portrait of this remarkable woman for young adults. Author Peggy Caravantes follows Baker&#x2019;s life from her childhood in the depths of poverty to her comedic rise in vaudeville and fame in Europe. This lively biography covers her outspoken participation in the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, espionage work for the French Resistance during World War II, and adoption of 12 children&#x2014;her &#x201c;rainbow tribe.&#x201d; Also included are informative sidebars on relevant topics such as the 1917 East St. Louis riot, Pullman railway porters, the Charleston, and more. The lush photographs, appendix updating readers on the lives of the rainbow tribe, source notes, and bibliography make this is a must-have resource for any student, Baker fan, or history buff.</p></p><p><p><b>Peggy Caravantes</b> is a former English and history teacher, middle school principal, and deputy school superintendent. She is the author of 16 books for middle grades and young adult readers, including <i>American Hero: The Audie Murphy Story </i>and<i> Petticoat Spies: Six Women Spies of the Civil War</i>. She lives in San Antonio, Texas.</p>Gr 6 Up&#x2014;Josephine Baker, entertainer, ex-pat, and activist, is a unique and controversial figure of the Jazz Age. Admitting that verifying the truth of Baker's life proves difficult, Caravantes offers a thorough biography. Where there is more than one version of a story, she is careful to explain the origin of the distortion&#x2014;often Baker herself, as she rewrote her own history to better suit the image she wanted to project. A remarkable woman nonetheless, Josephine, illiterate most of her life, pulled herself out of extreme poverty and often disturbing conditions in the slums of East St. Louis to become the toast of Paris, where racial prejudice was less pronounced than in the United States. An adoptive mother of 13 children, she was recruited to spy for France during World War II. Baker suffered numerous ups and downs, many of her own making, but she never lost her faith that all people should live in brotherhood. This is a straightforward biography, enhanced by photographs, sidebars, source notes, and bibliography. The prose is workmanlike, but Baker's story is inspiring enough to provide interesting reading beyond simple report writing. Recommended especially for collections in African American and women's studies, but it may also be useful for history and entertainment buffs in general.&#x2014;Katherine Koenig, The Ellis School, PA</p><h2>The Romantic Dogs</h2><p><p><strong>Listed as a "2009 Indie Next List Poetry Top Ten" book by the American Booksellers Association: Roberto Bolano as he saw himself, in his own first calling as a poet.</strong></p> Roberto Bolano (1953-2003) has caught on like a house on fire, and <em>The Romantic Dogs</em>, a bilingual collection of forty-four poems, offers American readers their first chance to encounter this literary phenomenon as a poet: his own first and strongest literary persona. These poems, wide-ranging in forms and length, have appeared in magazines such as <em>Harper's</em>, <em>Threepenny Review</em>, <em>The Believer</em>, <em>Boston Review</em>, <em>Soft Targets</em>, <em>Tin House</em>, <em>The Nation</em>, <em>Circumference</em>, <em>A Public Space</em>, and <em>Conduit</em>.

He has been acclaimed &#x201c;by far the most exciting writer to come from south of the Rio Grande in a long time&#x201d; (Ilan Stavans, <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>),&#x201d; and as &#x201c;the real thing and the rarest&#x201d; (Susan Sontag). Among his many prizes are the extremely prestigious Herralde de Novela Award and the Premio R�mulo Gallegos. He was widely considered to be the greatest Latin American writer of his generation.

She is the managing editor of <i>Harvard Review</i> and the web editor of <i>Zoland Poetry</i>.</p><i>The Savage Detectives</i>, the best-known novel by the Chilean-born Bola�o (1953&#x2013;2003) recently found spectacular success across the English-speaking world, bringing much attention to his other work. Now comes a very competently rendered bilingual selection of his fiery, if sometimes uncontrolled, verse. Bola�o began as a poet, and some of the work here seems to have come from an extraordinarily young man: a record of stormy, untamed teen emotion&#x2014;the depths of despair (From these nightmares I'll retain only/ these poor houses) or the heights of sexual adventures. Bola�o moves easily into a blend of surrealism and populism, with in-your-face gestures learned perhaps from Pablo Neruda, as when he watches a trail of nurses and a trail of scorpions wending their ways home. Other poems are closely tied to <i>The Savage Detectives</i>: Bola�o's dreamt motorcycle journey in The Donkey, mirroring the life of the real poet Mario Santiago, will send readers back to the fictionalized portrayals of Bola�o and Santiago (Arturo and Ulises) in the novel. Bola�o the poet's deliberate immaturity/ And splendors glimpsed on another planet can delight: they echo his brilliant but out-of-control authorial persona, with its high-speed, self-conscious verbal play, and those echoes will be more than enough to lead fans of his prose straight to his verse. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Bennison contradicts the common assumption that Islam somehow interrupted the smooth flow of Western civilization from its Graeco-Roman origins to its more recent European and American manifestations. Instead, she places Islamic civilization in the longer trajectory of Mediterranean civilizations and sees the &#x2018;Abbasid Empire (750&#x2013;1258 CE) as the inheritor and interpreter of Graeco-Roman traditions.</p><p>At its zenith the &#x2018;Abbasid caliphate stretched over the entire Middle East and part of North Africa, and influenced Islamic regimes as far west as Spain. Bennison&#x2019;s examination of the politics, society, and culture of the &#x2018;Abbasid period presents a picture of a society that nurtured many of the &#x201c;civilized&#x201d; values that Western civilization claims to represent, albeit in different premodern forms: from urban planning and international trade networks to religious pluralism and academic research. Bennison&#x2019;s argument counters the common Western view of Muslim culture as alien and offers a new perspective on the relationship between Western and Islamic cultures.</p></p><p><b>Amira K. Bennison</b> is senior lecturer in Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies at the University of Cambridge.<p>". . . concise and comprehensive."&#x2014;<i>Choice</i></p><br><p>"Amira Bennison's engaging history of the 'Abbasid caliphate moves beyond more conventional or drier accounts of political intrigue among ruling elites and sectarian squabbles. The author adopts a broader and deeper approach, focusing above all on &#x2018;the people:&#x2019; that mosaic of urban and rural folk who individually and collectively make up a civilization. Women, children, beggars, tricksters, merchants and pilgrims&#x2014;as well as the great cities that brought them all together&#x2014;are given fascinating coverage. Nor does the author neglect the community of scholars cultivated by the 'Abbasids who - in the fields of literature, philosophy, theology, mathematics and astronomy&#x2014;left their indelible mark upon Islamic civilization. The Great Caliphs is an important work which offers a new and stimulating perspective on an exciting era."&#x2014;David Waines, Lancaster University</p><br><p>"Aimed at the educated general reader, this volume offers a sweeping portrayal of major Islamic cultures and societies down to the 13th century AD and occasionally beyond. Drawing on both primary sources and secondary studies, the author provides a lively survey of politics, urban and rural life, societal and religious realities, trade and commerce, and elite culture and learning, with attention to issues of race/ethnicity, gender, and class. Her book is a thoughtful introduction to society, culture, and characteristic institutions as these took shape in the central and western reaches of the Islamic world, from Iran to Spain and Morocco, in the &#x2018;Abbasid era."&#x2014;William A. Graham, Harvard University</p><br></p><h2>Dime-Store Alchemy: The Art of Joseph Cornell (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>Now in Paperback<br><br>In&nbsp;<i>Dime-Store Alchemy</i>, poet Charles Simic reflects on the life and work of Joseph Cornell, the maverick surrealist who is one of America&#x2019;s great artists. Simic&#x2019;s spare prose is as enchanting and luminous as the mysterious boxes of found objects for which Cornell is justly renowned.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Charles Simic is a poet, essayist and translator. He has published twenty collections of his own poetry, five books of essays, a memoir, and numerous of books of translations. He has received many literary awards for his poems and his translations, including the Pulitzer Prize, the Griffin Prize and the MacArthur Fellowship. <i>The Voice at 3 A.M</i>., his selected later and new poems, was published in 2003 and a new book of poems <i>My Noiseless Entourage</i> came out in the spring of 2005. His new ebook from New York Review Books is titled <i>Confessions of a Poet Laureate. </i>It's hard to do justice to the charm and power of Joseph Cornell's boxes. His reliance on collage, indifference to technical display, and Surrealist mining of private obsession make him very much a modern artist, yet his work also brings to mind bourgeois parlors, the tidy vitrines of collectors, and the odds and ends children carry around for comfort and distraction. It is an art at once hermetic and matter-of-fact, sophisticated and simple. Appropriately, this study is neither a straightforward critical account of Cornell's art nor a merely literary embellishment of it, but rather a parallel text: written by Simic ( Hotel Insomnia ), one of our best poets, it includes his own poems and reminiscences, as well as quotations from a variety of other writers. Simic mingles biography and critical discussion with selections of writings from the artist's notebooks. The book emerges as a piece of writing constructed along the enigmatic lines of Cornell's art. And that art, as Simic sees it, gathers from the scattered pieces of the American past a new, redeeming reality; at heart, this art is a religious practice. Only seemingly random, Simic's approach develops both the plain detail of Cornell's life and illuminates the nature of his work.

In <i>Sky Burial, </i>Xinran has re-created Shu Wen&#x2019;s journey, painting an extraordinary portrait of a woman and a land, each at the mercy of fate and politics. It is an unforgettable, ultimately uplifting tale of love, loss, loyalty, and survival.</p><p>Xinran is the author of <b>The Good Women of China</b>, a seminal work about the lives of Chinese women. She was born in Beijing in 1958, and by the late 1980s had become a successful Chinese journalist. In 1997 she moved to London, where she currently writes a regular column in <i>The Guardian</i>.<b>1<br><br>Shu Wen</b><br><br>Her inscrutable eyes looked past me at the world outside the window -- the crowded street, the noisy traffic, the regimented lines of modern tower blocks. What could she see there that held such interest? I tried to draw her attention back.<br><br>"How long were you in Tibet?"<br><br>"More than thirty years," she said softly.<br><br>"Thirty years! But why did you go there? For what?"<br><br>"For love," she answered simply, again looking far beyond me at the empty sky outside.<br><br>"For love?"<br><br>"My husband was a doctor in the People's Liberation Army. His unit was sent to Tibet. Two months later, I received notification that he had been lost in action. We had been married for less than a hundred days.<br><br>"I refused to accept that he was dead," she continued. "No one at the military headquarters could tell me anything about how he had died. The only thing I could think of was to go to Tibet myself and find him."<br><br>I stared at her in disbelief. I could not imagine how a young woman at that time could have dreamed of traveling to a place as distant and as terrifying as Tibet. I myself had been on a short journalistic assignment to the eastern edge of Tibet in 1984. I had been overwhelmed by the altitude, the empty awe-inspiring landscape, and the harsh living conditions.<br><br>"I was a young woman in love," she said. "I did not think about what I might be facing. I just wanted to find my husband."<br><br>I had heard many love stories from callers to my radio program, but never one like this. My listeners were used to a society where it was traditional to suppress emotions and hide one's thoughts. I had not imagined that the young people of my mother's generation could love each other so passionately. People did not talk much about that time, still less about the bloody conflict between the Tibetans and the Chinese. I yearned to know this woman's story, which came from a time when China was recovering from the previous decade's devastating civil war between the Nationalists and Communists, and Mao was rebuilding the motherland.<br><br>"How did you meet your husband?"<br><br>"In Nanjing," she replied, her eyes softening slightly. "I was born there. Kejun and I met at medical school."<br><br>That morning, Shu Wen told me about her youth. She spoke like a woman who was unused to conversation, pausing often and gazing into the distance. But even after all this time, her words burned with love for her husband.<br><br>"I was seventeen when the Communists took control of the whole country in 1949. I remember being swept up in the wave of optimism that was flooding China. My father worked as a clerk in a Western company. He hadn't been to school, but he had taught himself. He believed strongly that my sister and I should receive an education. We were very lucky. Most of the population at this time were illiterate peasants. I went to a missionary school and then to Jingling Girls College to study medicine. The school had been started by an American woman in 1915. At that time there were only five Chinese students. When I was there, there were more than one hundred. After two years, I was able to go to the university to study medicine. I chose to specialize in dermatology.<br><br>"Kejun and I met when he was twenty-five and I was twenty-two. When I first saw him, he was acting as a laboratory assistant to the teacher in a dissection class. I had never seen a human being cut up before. I hid like a frightened animal behind my classmates, too nervous even to look at the white corpse soaked in formalin. Kejun kept catching my eye and smiling. He seemed to understand and sympathize with me. Later that day, he came looking for me. He loaned me a book of colored anatomy diagrams. He told me that I would conquer my fear if I studied them first. He was right. After reading the book several times over, I found the next dissection class much easier. From then on, Kejun patiently answered all my questions. Soon he became more than a big brother or a teacher to me. I began to love him with all my heart."<br><br>Shu Wen's eyes were so still -- locked on something I couldn't see.<br><br>"Everybody admired Kejun," she continued. "He had lost all his relatives during the Sino-Japanese War, and the government had paid for him to go to medical school. Because he was determined to repay this debt, he worked hard and was an outstanding student. But he was also kind and gentle to everyone around him, particularly to me. I was so happy . . . Then Kejun's professor came back from a visit to the battlefields of the Korean War and told Kejun of how the brave soldiers who were hurt and crippled in those terrible battles had to do without doctors and medicine, how nine out of ten of them died. The professor said he would have stayed there to help if he hadn't thought it his responsibility to pass on his medical knowledge to a new generation, so that more hospitals could have trained surgical staff. In war, medicine was the only lifeline: whatever the rights and wrongs of combat, saving the dying and helping the wounded were heroic acts.<br><br>"Kejun was deeply impressed by what his mentor had told him. He talked to me about it. The army was in desperate need of surgeons to help its wounded. He felt he ought to join up. Although I was frightened for him, I didn't want to hold him back. We were all suffering hardship at that time, but we knew it was for the greater good of the country. Everything was changing in China. Many people were packing their bags and heading for poor rural areas to carry out land reform, or going to the barren, uninhabited borderlands to turn the wilderness into fields. They went to the northeast and northwest to look for oil, or deep into the mountains and forests to fell trees and build railways. We regarded separation from our loved ones as a chance to demonstrate our loyalty to the motherland."<br><br>Shu Wen didn't tell me where Kejun's first army posting was. Perhaps she didn't know. What she did say was that he was away for two years.<br><br>I asked her whether she and Kejun wrote to each other. Shu Wen gave me one of her hard looks that made me ashamed of my ignorance.<br><br>"What kind of postal system do you imagine there was?" she asked. "War had created enormous upheaval. All over China, women were longing for news of husbands, brothers, and sons. I was not the only one. I had to suffer in silence.<br><br>"I heard nothing from Kejun for two years. Separation was not romantic, as I had imagined -- it was agony. The time crawled past. I thought I was going to go mad. But then Kejun returned, decorated with medals. His unit had sent him back to Nanjing to take an advanced course in Tibetan language and medicine.<br><br>"Over the next two years our love grew stronger. We talked about everything, encouraging and advising each other. Life in China seemed to be getting better day by day. Everybody had a job. They worked not for capitalist bosses but for the government and the motherland. There were free schools and hospitals. We were told that, through Chairman Mao's policies, China's economy would catch up with those of Britain and America in only twenty years. We also had the freedom to choose whom we would marry, rather than obeying the choices of our parents. I told Kejun about how our friend Mei had, to everyone's surprise, married Li, an unsophisticated country boy, and how Minhua, who seemed so meek, had eloped with Dalu, the head of the student council. Their parents had come to the university to complain. But I didn't tell him how, while he was away, I had had other admirers, and people had advised me not to pin my hopes on a man who risked death on the battlefield."<br><br>"When Kejun finished his studies, we decided to get married. He was awaiting orders from the military headquarters in Nanjing. I was working as a dermatologist at a big Nanjing hospital. In the eyes of our friends, many of whom had children, we had already waited late enough to marry. Kejun was twenty-nine, I was twenty-six. So we applied to the Party for permission. Although my father found it difficult to get used to the idea of free choice in marriage, he was very fond of Kejun and knew I had made a good decision. In any case, if I delayed marriage any longer, he would lose face. My older sister had already got married and had moved to Suzhou, taking my parents with her.<br><br>"Our wedding was celebrated in true 'revolutionary style.' A high-ranking political cadre was the witness and friends and colleagues wearing little red paper flowers were our escorts. For the refreshments we had three packets of Hengda cigarettes and some fruit candies. Afterward we moved into the hospital's married quarters. All we owned were two single wooden plank beds, two single quilts, a rosewood chest, a red paper cutout of two 'happiness' characters, and our marriage certificate decorated with a portrait of Chairman Mao. But we were ecstatically happy. Then, only three weeks later, Kejun's call-up papers arrived. His unit was to be posted to Tibet."<br><br>"We hardly had time to absorb the news before he left. The army arranged for me to be transferred to a hospital in Suzhou so that I could be close to my parents and sister. We hadn't requested a transfer but the Party organization said that it was only right that army dependents should have their families to look after them. I threw myself into my work so that I didn't think about how much I was missing Kejun. At night, when everyone else was asleep, I would take out Kejun's photograph and look at his smiling face. I thought all the time about what he had said just before he left: that he'd be back soon because he was anxious to be a good son to my parents and a good father to our children. I longed for him to return. But instead I received a summons to the Suzhou military headquarters to be told that he was dead."<br><br>We sat in silence together for some time. I did not want to interrupt her thoughts.<br><br>That night, Shu Wen and I shared a room in the small hotel next to the teahouse. During the two days we spent together, she opened up to me in a way that I had hardly dared hope.<br><br>But a few days later, when I called the hotel in Suzhou, she had already left. In a panic, I contacted the man who had called me about her.<br><br>"I don't know where she's gone," he said. "The other day she sent me a packet of green tea via the rice seller to say thank you for introducing her to Xinran. She said she hoped you would tell people her story. Since then I haven't met her again."<br><br>It was not until I went to Tibet again in 1995 to make a documentary that I began to understand what it might be like to live there. I and my four cameramen were rendered speechless by the emptiness of the landscape, the invisible wind that swept across the barren land, the high boundless sky, and the utter silence. My mind and soul felt clean and empty. I lost any sense of where I was or of the need to talk. The simple words that Shu Wen had used -- "cold," "color," "season," "loss" -- had a new resonance.<br><br>As I wrote Shu Wen's story, I tried to relive her journey from 1950s China to Tibet -- to see what she saw, to feel what she felt, to think what she thought. I deeply regretted having allowed Wen to leave without telling me how I could find her again. Her disappearance continues to haunt me. I dearly wish that this book might bring her back to me and that she will come to know that people all over the world are reading her story.<br><b>2<br><br>I Can't Leave Him in Tibet, Alone</b><br>Death Notice<br>This is to certify that Comrade Wang Kejun died in an incident in the east of Tibet on 24 March 1958, aged 29.<br>Issued by the Suzhou Military Office,<br>Jiangsu Province, 2 June 1958<br>Wen stood stunned on the steps of the military headquarters, the summer rain of the Yangtze delta monsoon drenching her hair and face.<br><br>Kejun, dead? Her husband of less than a hundred days, dead? The sweetness of those first days after their marriage lingered in her heart. She could still feel their warmth. Of those hundred days, they had only spent three weeks together. It was impossible that he was dead.<br><br>He had been so strong, so talkative, so full of life when he set out for Tibet. An army doctor wouldn't have been directly involved in the fighting. What "incident" was this? How did he die? Why could nobody give her any information? They had not even added a few words to testify that he died a revolutionary martyr as they always did for soldiers who fell in battle. Why not?<br><br>In the flood of buoyant "Reports of Victory from the People's Liberation Army on Entering Tibet," there had been no mention of an incident in which Kejun could have died. Staff at the military office responsible for comforting the widows and orphans of fallen soldiers had told Wen privately that they hadn't received any of the standard battlefield bulletins from Tibet.<br><br>Wen stood in the Suzhou street, unheeding of the rain. The busy life of the town continued around her, but she noticed nothing. An hour passed, then another. She was soaked in sorrow and bewilderment.<br><br>The chiming bells of Cold Mountain Temple called her back from her grief. Returning to the hospital where she worked, truly alone for the first time, a thought flashed through her mind. What if Kejun had simply been separated from his unit, like all those soldiers who were mistakenly reported dead when they were actually on their way home? Perhaps he was in danger or had fallen ill. She couldn't leave him in Tibet, alone.<br><br>The idea, conceived in that chill rain, that she should go and find Kejun proved to be so powerful that, despite all the attempts of her family, friends, and colleagues to talk her out of it, Wen was determined to join her husband's regiment and travel to Tibet. She rushed around every government office she could find, tearfully thrusting her marriage certificate, Kejun's parting note, even his few personal possessions -- his towel, handkerchief, and tea mug -- at everyone she saw. "My husband must be alive," she insisted. "He wouldn't abandon his new wife and the future mother of his children."</p><h2>A Fatal Yarn (A Knit &amp; Nibble Mystery)</h2><p><b><i>Pamela Paterson and her Knit and Nibble club must clear the name of one of their knitters when he's accused of murdering the mayor . . .</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> The trees in Arborville, New Jersey, have started sporting sweaters.

There was nothing I enjoyed more than being here to cuddle with a cat or a dog starved for affection.</p><p>But on this particular sunny October morning, I had not come to comfort the shelter&#x2019;s inhabitants. Instead I sat beside my future stepson, Finn, as we waited for the owner, Shawn Cuddahee. He would be bringing a very special girl from the cattery.</p><p>Finn was in town on a college break. His stepdad, Tom Stewart, and I were getting married in a week and Finn had handed in research papers and taken a few tests early so he could be part of our celebration. As usual he planned to volunteer at the shelter during his stay in town. But he had something else on his mind today. Since his last time volunteering, Finn hadn&#x2019;t been able to get a certain cat out of his head&#x2014;a little tortoiseshell kitty, or &#x201c;tortie&#x201d; as they were usually called. Since she was still available, Finn wanted to adopt her. But the cat would have to live with Tom and me until he moved from the dorm into his own apartment next semester.</p><p>As we sat on folding chairs in the cluttered space, Snug, the African gray parrot who believed he was in charge of the office, entertained us. He promenaded back and forth on the horizontal dowel Shawn had nailed up near the ceiling, saying, &#x201c;Hello, Jillian Hart. Hello there,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Finn, clean the dog crates. Clean the dog crates.&#x201d;</p><p>When Shawn finally rushed through the door from the kennel and cattery, his face was flushed with agitation. And he wasn&#x2019;t holding the tortie. &#x201c;Sorry, Finn, but she&#x2019;s gone again. She is the sneakiest little girl we&#x2019;ve ever had.&#x201d;</p><p>Finn stood. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay. I planned on working today anyway and she always comes back. She&#x2019;ll probably be here by the time Jillian picks me up later.&#x201d; He looked my way. &#x201c;Anything I need to do to help you guys with the wedding setup when I&#x2019;m done here?&#x201d;</p><p>I laughed. &#x201c;Though I&#x2019;m certain you&#x2019;re dying to wrap vines and rosebuds on Kara&#x2019;s banister, we&#x2019;ll take care of it.&#x201d; Kara was my stepdaughter&#x2014;my late husband&#x2019;s only child. She was hosting the reception at her gorgeous new house.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;d probably be more useful here.&#x201d; Finn looked at Shawn. &#x201c;Where should I start?&#x201d;</p><p>Snug piped in with &#x201c;Clean the dog crates, Finn. Clean the dog crates.&#x201d;</p><p>Shawn still seemed a little annoyed and preoccupied, but not with Snug. He bent and retrieved a shoe box from under the desk and set it down on the battered metal surface. He glanced back and forth between us. &#x201c;You sure you want a cat who brings this kind of stuff home all the time? &#x2019;Cause I got a couple across the road from here who&#x2019;ll always take the difficult cats. They&#x2019;ve got a barnful to protect their chicken feed from rodents. Cats do that quite efficiently.&#x201d;</p><p>I leaned forward and examined the contents of the box while Finn merely seemed amused.</p><p>Shawn picked out a shoelace and held it up. &#x201c;This is so old it couldn&#x2019;t hold anything together.&#x201d;</p><p>I spied what looked like a ragged sock, several coins, buttons, more shoelaces, a filthy little sachet pillow and a baby&#x2019;s knitted hat. I looked up at Finn and smiled. &#x201c;Are you adopting a cat or a magpie?&#x201d;</p><p>Snug said, &#x201c;Magpie&#x201d; three times and did a wolf whistle to top it off. None of us could keep a straight face after that one.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it.&#x201d; Finn grinned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call her Magpie. It&#x2019;s perfect, Jillian.&#x201d;</p><p>Shawn shook his head. &#x201c;All I can say is you&#x2019;ll have your hands full. She may become a domestic indoor cat right away, since she&#x2019;s real friendly, but she&#x2019;s an escape artist.&#x201d; Shawn looked at me. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s always sneaking out to hunt for anything she can drag back here.&#x201d; He waved his hand at the box. &#x201c;This stuff is just from the last few days. I wanted you to see evidence of what you&#x2019;re getting yourself into if you plan on keeping her through the holidays, Jillian.&#x201d;</p><p>Finn glanced my way, a hint of anxiety in his eyes. &#x201c;You said it would be no problem, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Absolutely no problem. I&#x2019;m excited to have her with us.&#x201d; I smiled because it was true. What kitty didn&#x2019;t challenge its human caretaker?</p><p>Finn went on as if Shawn and I needed more convincing. &#x201c;Plus, I&#x2019;ll be living with her and Tom starting the second week in December and through most of January when we have semester break.&#x201d;</p><p>I could tell this kitty must indeed be special. Finn <i>really</i> wanted to bring her home.</p><p>Shawn&#x2019;s phone rang and he answered, &#x201c;Mercy Animal Sanctuary.&#x201d; After listening for several seconds, he said, &#x201c;This cat is wearing one of <i>my</i> collars? You&#x2019;re sure?&#x201d; He nodded and glanced at Finn. &#x201c;What does the kitty look like?&#x201d; More listening and more pointed looks at Finn. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right there.&#x201d;</p><p>Finn cocked his head and stared at Shawn. &#x201c;Was that about Magpie?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yeah. Did you bring a crate for this girl?&#x201d; Shawn asked.</p><p>I nodded. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s in my van. Someone found her, I take it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yup. And you&#x2019;ll never guess who. You can follow me and then <i>please</i> take this little troublemaker off my hands.&#x201d; But Shawn smiled. He had a soft spot for the troublemakers.</p><p>We left the office with Snug bobbing his head and chanting &#x201c;Magpie&#x201d; over and over.</p><p>The route Shawn took confused me at first. True, I&#x2019;d lived in Mercy for seven years, but there were more back roads than people in this town. Then I recognized where we were headed and turned to Finn sitting beside me. &#x201c;How did Magpie end up at Ed&#x2019;s Swap Shop?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You got me. This should be a fun mystery to unravel, Jillian. I love it.&#x201d;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t help smiling. &#x201c;A cat who collects other people&#x2019;s trash ends up with a man who does the same thing. Seems fitting.&#x201d;</p><p>Finn laughed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfect she&#x2019;s with Ed.&#x201d;</p><p>We considered Ed Duffy a relative. He was the lovable, gentle live-in companion of Tom&#x2019;s mother, Karen. Ed had been collecting junk for years and actually did a steady business either swapping his treasures for different items that caught his fancy, taking things on consignment or selling some things for cash. Finn spent almost as much time with Karen and Ed as he did with Tom. In fact, when we pulled onto the neglected patch of asphalt Ed called a parking lot, the old guy opened the door and Finn&#x2019;s rat terrier, Yoshi, raced straight for him. Ed often kept Yoshi at the shop when Finn or Tom didn&#x2019;t plan on being home. Tom must have dropped the dog off before he went to pick up the new suit he&#x2019;d bought for our wedding.</p><p>Finn opened his arms and the dog leapt into them. After licking his beloved Finn&#x2019;s face and wiggling with joy, Yoshi jumped down and greeted me as he&#x2019;d been taught&#x2014;by sitting and waiting for me to pet him. Then it was time to say hello to Shawn, who was already crouched and waiting to scratch Yoshi behind the ears.</p><p>Ed called, &#x201c;Y&#x2019;all come on and help me with this little feline problem I&#x2019;m presented with.&#x201d;</p><p>Soon we all crowded into the store. Decades ago it had been a family home and the stacks of toys, tools, small appliances, magazines, books, lamps, fishing gear and so much more made what had once been the living area seem tiny. And there before us was this battered old love seat&#x2014;obviously a recent addition. It filled what little space had been left in the center of the room. Since we couldn&#x2019;t get past it, we all stood staring down at its dingy brown upholstery.</p><p>Ed stroked his gray beard. &#x201c;This here is my dilemma.&#x201d; He looked down at a whining Yoshi. &#x201c;Help me out, fella. Make some noise.&#x201d;</p><p>Yoshi complied by jumping on the love seat and yelping at the space between the love seat cushions.</p><p>We all heard a cat meow in reply. I would have expected a hiss if one of my three cats found itself trapped in a sofa, but Magpie had been at the shelter so long she was probably used to barking dogs.</p><p>I put my hand to my mouth and muttered, &#x201c;Oh my. Is she stuck?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Darn right,&#x201d; Ed replied. &#x201c;Only good thing is she can almost get her head through that crack and I saw the tag on the collar, got a flashlight for a better look. Like I said on the phone, she&#x2019;s one of yours, Shawn. But I&#x2019;ve been working for an hour to coax her out of there and it ain&#x2019;t happenin&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Actually, Gramps, she&#x2019;s now my cat.&#x201d; Finn smiled at Ed. He&#x2019;d taken to calling him Gramps not long after he came to live with Tom.</p><p>Ed&#x2019;s bushy eyebrows rose in surprise. &#x201c;Well, there&#x2019;s a new development. Guess she needs savin&#x2019; right quick, then.&#x201d;</p><p>Shawn addressed Finn. &#x201c;Yoshi&#x2019;s done his job. Maybe he needs to go in the back while we work on this problem. The cat&#x2019;s probably spooked a little.&#x201d;</p><p>Finn had to squeeze past the sofa, and as soon as Yoshi was closed up in the back room, he returned and stood by Shawn again. I fit my fingers between the back of the love seat and the attached cushions. I used a soft coaxing voice. &#x201c;Hey, baby. You okay?&#x201d; I wiggled my fingers. The sofa was old and dirty, and I was thankful the dark brown of the cushions hid a lot more than the stickiness I felt.</p><p>It only took a minute for Magpie to pop her head out. Finn laughed and whipped out his phone to snap a picture. &#x201c;Got to think of a caption for this when I put it up on Instagram.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Such a pretty girl,&#x201d; I whispered, stroking the side of her face.</p><p>Meanwhile, Shawn was looking underneath the love seat in the back to check if she&#x2019;d gotten in through a rip in the fabric. He stood and shook his head. &#x201c;She either got in there the way she&#x2019;s trying to come out, or came in through the bottom.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no hole in the bottom, Shawn,&#x201d; Ed said. &#x201c;I woulda seen it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So she can get out, but she&#x2019;s choosing not to.&#x201d; Shawn smiled wryly. &#x201c;Typical cat.&#x201d;</p><p>Sure enough, Magpie began to worm through the space and finally Finn couldn&#x2019;t stand it anymore. He grabbed hold under her front legs and eased her out.</p><p>It was then that we saw she had a thin gold chain wrapped around one front leg.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah. So you were Dumpster-diving again.&#x201d; Finn held her up and looked into her eyes so Shawn and I could free the chain. It seemed to have an etched gold locket attached.</p><p>Magpie, with her mottled black-and-gold fur and pale green eyes, was indeed a beauty. Shawn held her back legs firmly so I could untangle the jewelry. I felt the same stickiness on her paws. Had someone spilled a soft drink on the sofa? An <i>entire</i> soft drink? Because that was what her fur felt like.</p><p>When we were finished, Finn held his new friend close. I stared down at the locket and saw something grimy on my hands.</p><p><i>Wait a minute. What&#x2019;s gotten all over me?</i></p><p>I slipped the jewelry into my pocket. My palms were rusty red and I held my fingers to my nose. I immediately recognized the smell.</p><p><i>Blood</i>.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Two</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2014;I have blood on my hands.&#x201d; I tried my best not to sound as panicked as I felt. &#x201c;Shawn, please check Magpie. She might be injured.&#x201d;</p><p>I stared down at my palms again and realized my hands were shaking. Did the cat sneak into that sofa because she was wounded? Or vomiting blood? Cats usually hide when they&#x2019;re ill or hurt, so that might explain why she was hunkered down in an old piece of furniture.</p><p>Finn held her firmly for Shawn&#x2019;s inspection, and after a thorough examination, Shawn smiled at me. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s fine. Looks as healthy as the last time I saw her before she managed to open her crate and get out the cattery door.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then there&#x2019;s blood on that sofa. Or under the cushions.&#x201d; I glanced at Ed. &#x201c;Could there be a dead animal in there? Because this is <i>not</i> just a little bit of blood.&#x201d; I held my hands out to him.</p><p>He grimaced. &#x201c;Guess we have to tear the thing apart and then I&#x2019;m takin&#x2019; it to the dump. Sure as heck can&#x2019;t trade this old thing to anyone and I don&#x2019;t want it around. I&#x2019;ll get my big knife and start taking it apart&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. see what we got.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You find this outside somewhere, Ed?&#x201d; Shawn asked.</p><p>The old guy had already wrangled around the sofa and was behind the store counter. &#x201c;Yup. By the clothing donation box they got set up on Harkins Road.&#x201d; Ed held up a container of disinfecting wipes. &#x201c;Catch, Jillian.&#x201d;</p><p>He tossed them to me and I started cleaning my hands, grateful to be rid of the mess. Meanwhile, Finn fetched the crate from my car and brought it in. With my help, Finn put his new kitty in. Within seconds she began fiddling with the latch.</p><p>All of us now had blood somewhere on us and I passed the wipes around.</p><p>Ed said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what you get for sticking your hand in there. I wasn&#x2019;t about to get chewed up by an angry cat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s not angry, Gramps. She&#x2019;s scared.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever you say, son.&#x201d; Ed sounded unconvinced.</p><p>Shawn put his face close to the sofa cushions. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t hear anything, can&#x2019;t smell anything but blood. Probably any animal in there was freshly killed by our friend Magpie.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You think so?&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t want to believe it, but cats <i>are</i> predators.</p><p>Shawn read my mind. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been around cats long enough to know that&#x2019;s probably what happened. A bird or squirrel or a rat, no doubt. I&#x2019;ll help Ed take this old thing to the dump after we find out what&#x2019;s inside. A critter that needs burying, if you&#x2019;re up to the job.&#x201d;</p><p>Finn said, &#x201c;Are we dismantling the sofa right now? I hate to leave Yoshi locked up much longer.&#x201d;</p><p>I had plenty to do myself and didn&#x2019;t want to end up with the task of burying a poor, dead animal. I did have a wedding in my imminent future, after all. Then something caught my eye&#x2014;a coppery glint between the cushions. I almost touched it, but Shawn grabbed my hand. He&#x2019;d seen it, too.</p><p>I looked at him, my heart beating a lot faster than seconds ago. &#x201c;Is that what I think it is?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Looks like a bullet to me. Guess we won&#x2019;t be touching this thing until our favorite evidence collector checks it out first. I&#x2019;m sure you or Ed can call up Deputy Candace Carson, tell her we&#x2019;ve just made her day.&#x201d; Shawn glanced at Finn. &#x201c;I need to get back to the shelter. You coming?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Somebody probably shot a squirrel or something, huh?&#x201d; Finn said, sounding concerned.</p><p>Shawn and Ed exchanged skeptical glances. Shawn said, &#x201c;Looks like&nbsp;.22 ammo to me. Not exactly a hunting gun. But we can&#x2019;t make assumptions. Lord knows Candace has drilled that into me by now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I promised to help Shawn with the bales of hay he has to move or I&#x2019;d stay until you and Candace get this figured out.&#x201d; Finn looked at Ed. &#x201c;I can come back and we can move this out of here later, okay, Gramps?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Son, I got it in here and I can get it out. Been hauling stuff for years, long before you were born.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Um, hello?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s with y&#x2019;all? You think I can&#x2019;t lift a little piece of furniture? Ed, Candace and I can handle this. Go on, you two.&#x201d;</p><p>Finn smiled. &#x201c;Sorry. We&#x2019;re sounding like a bunch of macho guys, aren&#x2019;t we? I&#x2019;ll let Yoshi out, say good-bye and meet you outside, Shawn.&#x201d;</p><p>Soon they were gone, leaving Ed, Yoshi and me alone with a dirty love seat and a determined cat. How long before she got out of that crate?</p><p>I focused on the sofa and felt a stirring inside that told me we wouldn&#x2019;t be finding any dead animals today. Maybe because after all the times I&#x2019;d helped Candace on cases, she&#x2019;d taught me well, taught me to pay attention to my instincts and even the tiniest of fears.</p><p>I tossed th...</p></p><h2>Corto Maltese: In Siberia</h2><p>Nominated for both the Eisner and Harvey Awards for Best Foreign Language Publication! <br> <br> With this book Pratt leaves behind the short story form he&#x2019;d used for twenty-one interrelated tales and presents a truly epic graphic novel. In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution and the First World War, Corto Maltese is engaged by the Red Lanterns&#x2015;a Chinese secret society made up entirely of women&#x2015;to find an armored train laden with gold that belonged to the last Russian Tsar, Nicholas II. They aren&#x2019;t the only ones lusting after the treasure. The adventure, which shifts from the hidden courts of Venice to the mysterious alleys of Hong Kong, from Shanghai to Manchuria and Mongolia to Siberia, also attracts regular and irregular armies, as well as revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries. The sweeping plot allows Pratt to fully investigate the complicated and competing motivations of his cast that includes the return of Rasputin and the introduction of the cold and dangerous Duchess Marina Seminova, the enigmatic warrior/spy named Shanghai-Lil, and historical figures such as the &#x201c;Mad Baron&#x201d; Roman Ungern-Sternberg, a Russian general who who sees himself as the modern-day Genghis Khan!</p><p><b>Hugo Pratt</b>&nbsp;(1927-1995) is considered one of the great graphic novelists in the history of the medium. His strips, graphic works, and watercolors have been exhibited at the Grand Palais in Paris and the Vittoriano in Rome, and a landmark show in 2011 at the Pinacotheque in Paris drew 215,000 visitors, hailing Pratt as "the inventor of the literary comic strip."In this latest escapade featuring Corto Maltese ( The Early Years ), we find the sailor and gentleman of fortune in Asia. It is 1919, Russia is in the throes of revolution, the czarist army in retreat. Imperial China is in ruins, shattered into a horde of private kingdoms ruled by warlords. From Manchuria, Japanese, English and American forces manipulate what's left of the republic to satisfy their own conflicting interests. Acclaimed European cartoonist Pratt sends his celebrated creation Corto Maltese into this political caldron in search of adventure, love and an armored train loaded with czarist gold. Corto and his demented, mercurial ally, Rasputin, find themselves confronting one of the most lunatic generals of the White Army. The black-and-white drawings in this tremendously entertaining strip are historically based and beautifully delineated, expressive yet precise. One of the world's great adventure strips. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Black Thunder: Gabriel&#39;s Revolt: Virginia, 1800</h2><p>'Gabriel Prosser's 1800 slave revolt allowed Bontemps to warn of the rebellion that would come of poverty and racial oppression.

The Sanskrit word yoga has many meanings: to unite, to join, to contemplate, and to be absorbed. When we practice it regularly, we unite our mind, body, and spirit. We connect with ourselves, and we are able to connect more meaningfully with others and the world we are in. It&#x2019;s like calling a meeting with your whole self so that you can check in on you.<br><br>Yoga is the ultimate act of self-study. It is a daily dive deep into ourselves, where we come back refreshed and ready for all comers. Yoga goes much deeper than stretching. How you live in your body, how you experience it, is how you live in your mind, and the other way around, too. What do I mean by this? If your mind is tense your body is tense, and it dominos through the rest of your life. If your mind is out of balance, your body is out of balance, and your life can spiral out of control. If your mind is calm, open, and focused, your body and life also reflect and expand accordingly.<br><br>Yoga shows us how to wrangle the mind to serve us throughout our lives. Without such wrangling, the mind can spin off in many destructive directions. But get that monkey mind in hand, and your potential is limitless. Boundaries fade and life expands . . . the more you practice.<br><br>Why believe me? I&#x2019;m not the only one to expound on the benefits of yoga. Many researchers throughout the world have studied yoga and meditation. They&#x2019;ve just firmed up what we who do it already know: a regular yoga practice reduces stress, calms the mind, makes you happier, eases pain, increases mental sharpness, and prevents and heals all kinds of ailments and diseases. Yoga is a practice for living a better life, one deep breath at a time.<br>A BRIEF HISTORY OF YOGA--VERY BRIEF<br><br>No one knows exactly when the practice of yoga began, which makes sense since it is something that exists always and is inside of all of us. Traditionally, yoga is a practice to unite with the Absolute, recognizing that the Absolute is within all of us. Yoga joins together the body, mind, and spirit as one. Like air, water, and earth, yoga is an element that is contained in all of us. In the Indus Valley of northwestern India, stone carvings depicting figures in yoga poses have been found dating back five thousand years or more. There is a common misconception that yoga developed out of Hinduism. However, Hinduism&#x2019;s religious structures evolved much later and incorporated practices and ideas that are yoga traditions. Yoga probably arrived in the United States in the late 1800s, but it did not become widely known until the 1960s, when it became popular in the entertainment, pop culture, hippie, and intellectual scenes. George Harrison&#x2019;s interest in Eastern mysticism was sparked upon meeting with Swami Vishnu-devananda, the founder of Sivananda Yoga centers around the world, who handed Harrison a copy of his book The Illustrated Book of Yoga while the Beatles were on location in the Bahamas filming Help! The Beatles began to study Transcendental Meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in London and Wales, and eventually at his ashram in Rishikesh in the Himalayas. The Beatles were joined by Mia Farrow, Donovan, and Mike Love of the Beach Boys, who all jumped on the bandwagon.<br><br>Around the same time, Harvard professor Richard Alpert, now known as Ram Dass, conducted meditation and psychedelic experiments on prisoners. Upon being asked to leave Harvard for his unorthodox experiments, Alpert went to India to be with Neem Karoli Baba, who would become his guru and give him the name Ram Dass, meaning servant of Lord Rama. Yogis Sri Krishnamacharya, Swami Sivananda, Shri Yogendra, and Swami Kuvalayananda made efforts to include women and foreigners, who had been excluded from the practice. They also believed that Indian philosophy could coexist with Western science and medicine, an innovative idea that carries into the present. Swami Satchidananda, one of Sivananda&#x2019;s students, demonstrated yoga at Woodstock. The practice of yoga spread even deeper into the West when the influential B.K.S. Iyengar began his teacher/student relationship with the famous violinist Yehudi Menuhin in 1954. Today, over $6 billion a year is spent on yoga, and approximately 15 million people in the United States are practicing. There are many styles, and hybrid styles, of yoga practice.<br><br>The poses are designed to heal you from the inside out. Each pose has specific purposes and benefits ranging from improving circulation, regulating digestion, enhancing metabolism, and improving range of motion to control, balance, and more. The yoga poses will carve out an optimal functioning body and mind. They will strengthen, lengthen, and shape your muscles in the best way to operate your entire system. An added bonus is that your body will be energized, strong, lean, and toned. Your skin will be glowing and fresh with life. The poses, in short, are designed to build your body&#x2019;s energy stores from the inside out. Unfortunately the history of yoga hasn&#x2019;t been immune to setbacks, misunderstandings, and corruption. Turned off by false gurus, religious overtones, attempted ownership, aggressive styles, and rigid prerequisites, many people have been excluded from the massive benefits of a practice that is a gift to everyone.<br><br>Patanjali was a sage and a scholar who compiled one of the earliest texts on yoga, called the Yoga Sutras. The Sutras could have been written as early as the first or second century BC or as late as the fifth century AD, exact dates are unknown. In the text, he outlined the Yamas and Niyamas, which together made up an ethical code of conduct for yogis to observe. Before we look at his code, I want to pause for a moment to focus on one aspect of it: ahimsa. It is an observance in the Yamas that calls for one to practice nonviolence. It&#x2019;s a practice in kindness to all living things, including ourselves.<br><br>Yoga is about recognizing and being good to ourselves from the inside out. Don&#x2019;t confuse being good to yourself with being selfish. We cannot extend love to others unless we truly love ourselves. If we are constantly hard on and judging ourselves, we do the same to others. We extend to others how we feel about ourselves. An easy way to see how we are treating ourselves is to look to those around us. They are a reflection of what&#x2019;s going on with us.<br><br>Hopefully, we have all treated ourselves well at times and have enjoyed how good that feels. The more we practice yoga, the better we feel, and the better we are able to cultivate a lasting attitude of kindness. This sets us up for a whole lot more ease in all areas of our lives.<br>The Eight Limbs of Yoga<br><br>Patanjali wrote about the system known as Ashtanga Yoga, or the eight limbs of yoga. Here are the ethical guidelines he developed to be followed by any practitioner of yoga, including you, if you&#x2019;re so inclined:<br><br>1. Yama: Restraint, which lets us refrain from violence, lying, and stealing.<br><br>2. Niyama: Observances. Following a set of outlined rules that lead to contentment, purity, and tolerance.<br><br>3. Asana: The physical exercises (yoga poses).<br><br>4. Pranayama: The breathing techniques.<br><br>5. Pratyahara: The preparation for meditation, a withdrawal of the mind from the senses.<br><br>6. Dharana: A state of concentration and being able to hold the mind on one object for a specific time.<br><br>7. Dhyana: The act of meditation, the ability to focus on nothing, or no objects, indefinitely.<br><br>8. Samadhi: Absorption. Being present, and the realization of the essential nature of the self.<br><br>I believe that when the number of people practicing yoga reaches a critical mass, many of our collective mental and physical health problems will begin to fade away. But for yoga to really go mainstream people need to understand that its practice is something anyone can do.<br><br>You don&#x2019;t have to follow Patanjali&#x2019;s eight-limbed path, or move away to an ashram to have yoga benefit your life. You just have to begin to practice it. Simple. Easy. Powerful.<br><br>What do you do first? Breathe.<br><br>What next? Observe.<br>OBSERVE WITHOUT JUDGMENT<br><br>Observation without judgment is the basis for all meditation including yoga, which after all is simply a moving meditation. Yoga becomes truly useful when you can translate this attention and observation into all areas of your life. Otherwise, it would just be a lot of stretching and bending, which is fine and good, but not really the point.<br><br>You are the same person whether you&#x2019;re on the yoga mat or off of it. Practicing yoga is a great opportunity to observe your habits and tendencies. Do you give up too easily? Work too hard, but not effectively? Get down on yourself when things don&#x2019;t work out? Show off when things are going well? When we practice yoga we are giving ourselves the space to observe all this without judgment, to gain perspective, and cultivate positive, lasting change.<br><br>When we practice observing without judgment, we are giving ourselves the space and time to remove ourselves from the stresses of getting emotionally involved in the moment and simultaneously softening the desire to react solely on impulse. This will decrease stress and unwind tension at its source. Increased stress and anxiety can raise blood pressure, affect the immune system, and over time can promote sickness and disease. Good thing those long, deep breaths are available to rush in and save the day!<br>BALANCING ACT: BEING HERE, NOW<br><br>When you are balancing perfectly in a tree pose, everything is easy; your breath is deep and relaxed, and your muscles are working for you just as you&#x2019;d like. It&#x2019;s pure and simple. Efficient. When you are having a great day, the same things occur. Your breathing is relaxed, your body is working harmoniously with your mind; everything just feels easier because you are in a state of balance.<br><br>Why is balance important? From a life lesson standpoint, it&#x2019;s about learning to enjoy yourself without getting the ego involved. Say you&#x2019;re doing a headstand. The moment you think to yourself, &#x201c;Wow, I&#x2019;m doing this pose!&#x201d; is usually the moment you&#x2019;ll topple out of it. You take yourself out of the moment and knock yourself off balance when you judge and think about what you are doing, rather than experiencing and enjoying what you are doing.<br><br>That&#x2019;s what yoga teaches. How to be fully present now, no matter the circumstance. We focus on breathing because each inhale creates more space in our bodies. We focus on movement, as each movement reminds us that every moment invites a new opportunity for change. Each exhale allows us to let go of the moment that has just passed. Our attention to each breath keeps us in the now.<br><br>Learning to savor the moment keeps us from living in constant worry and fear and tension over things that haven&#x2019;t happened yet and may never come to pass. Practicing yoga helps us to undo these bad -mental habits and stress triggers that we often unknowingly pick up along the way.<br><br>But you might be asking, &#x201c;What if the now is crappy? How can living in the moment help that?&#x201d; When your life is not in balance and you&#x2019;re struggling to achieve stability, practicing observation without judgment gets really interesting . . . and very useful. How? Because you can learn to distance yourself from the roller-coaster ride of your emotions and circumstances but still enjoy the ride of life.<br><br>Outside means of escape like alcohol, drug use, and even overeating are a means of pushing uncertainty away and covering it up temporarily. And they may feel comforting for a moment, but I don&#x2019;t need to tell you that eventually they will cause more trouble than they ever solve. There is a big lesson in experiencing uncertainty and calamity with a sober focus. The most chaotic moments are the ones from which we can learn the most. Let&#x2019;s go back to tree pose. When your tree pose is going crazy and you&#x2019;re falling, and your leg is burning, and it feels impossible to maintain any sort of stability, practice observing what&#x2019;s happening instead of getting wrapped up in the circumstance. If you can learn to be easy with your breath in these moments, your body and mind will follow.<br><br>All the body&#x2019;s systems and processes--your nerves, your emotions--take instruction from what is going on with your breath. When your breathing is easy and deep, your body works efficiently and your mind settles. That doesn&#x2019;t mean that your balance (in tree pose or anywhere else) will be perfect and your life will be seamless, but you&#x2019;ll be better equipped to deal with the wobbles and earthquakes that get thrown into the mix.<br><br>You can fall out of a tree pose with ease, or with frustration and a sense of defeat. Just like you can take a spill in your life and decide to dust yourself off--with a chuckle or an annoyed grunt--and get back up, or you can stay down, lie there, and give up. It&#x2019;s entirely up to you. It&#x2019;s your life . . . and your practice. And as I said before, what you practice on the mat is what you end up doing in your life.<br><br>Any of the yoga poses could be substituted in this analogy. How you practice is much more meaningful than what yoga moves you can or cannot do. A successful tree pose probably won&#x2019;t change your life. Learning how to keep your breath easy, long, and deep no matter what the circumstance? It absolutely will.<br>FIND YOUR MEANING<br><br>I&#x2019;m going to challenge you over and over to imagine yoga as moving beyond the poses and even the breath. I&#x2019;d like to persuade you to expand your idea of what yoga can do for you beyond deep breaths, down dogs, and feeling great, although yoga is also about all of the above. What if you could be practicing and enjoying all the benefits of yoga and meditation at every moment during your entire life? Imagine having an extra split second to make decisions, more space inside your body and mind, and the ability to feel energized, creative, strong, open, and inspired all day long.<br><br>The more often we check in, or tune in, the more we feel connected, the healthier our bodies and minds get, and the more inspired and aware we become. It&#x2019;s like juicing up a rechargeable lightbulb with no limit to the brightness and quality of the bulb. You are the bulb. Your yoga is the current. Your possibilities are endless.<br><br>When you are in the state of flow, you come into balance and experience happiness, health, and joy. The practice of yoga is designed to keep you in the state of flow so you can experience health, happiness, and joy during your entire life. The practice of yoga clears the clutter that collects on you like dust during each day. The practice of yoga brings you back to remembering your true nature, back to happiness, health, and joy. You didn&#x2019;t arrive in this world full of worries. Yoga shows you how to dissolve anything that is blocking you from living out your full potential.</p><h2>The Brain and the Inner World: An Introduction to the Neuroscience of the Subjective Experience</h2><p><i>The Brain and the Inner World</i> is an eagerly-awaited account of a momentous revolution.

Mommy told me you would try, but I didn't think you would be able to break away from rehearsals, especially rehearsals for a new Broadway show!<br><br>Although Mommy always tells me she is not envious, I know she is, for I have often found her sighing and gazing longingly at a program from one of your Broadway productions. Daddy knows she's envious too, and he feels sorry for her. Singing at the hotel from time to time is not enough, especially for someone with Mommy's talent. I think it hurts more when someone comes up to her afterward and says, "You were wonderful; you should be on Broadway."<br><br>We have this wonderful hotel, which has grown more and more successful, and Mommy is highly respected as a business woman, but I think to Mommy the hotel is like a ball and chain. I have already told both Mommy and Daddy that I don't want to become a hotel executive. My brother Jefferson can be the one who steps into their shoes, not me. I want to be a pianist and attend the Bernhardt school in New York just like you and Mommy did.<br><br>I know I should be very happy. Mommy and Daddy are making my Sweet Sixteen the grandest party ever at the hotel. Everyone is coming, even Granddaddy Longchamp and Gavin. I'm so looking forward to seeing Gavin; it's been months and months since we've seen each other although we write to each other practically every week.<br><br>I bet Mommy wishes that Aunt Fern couldn't leave college and come, although she wouldn't tell Daddy that. Last time Aunt Fern was home, Mommy and she had a terrible row over her grades and a behavior report the dean sent.<br><br>Bronson will bring Grandmother Laura, but I doubt she will know where she is or whose party she's at. Sometimes when I see her, she calls me Clara. Yesterday, she called me Dawn. Mommy says I should just smile and pretend to be whoever she thinks I am.<br><br>In a few days, I will be sixteen and get mountains of wonderful presents. In so many ways, I really am a very lucky girl. My classmates tease me and call me Princess because I live high on the hill in a beautiful house and my family owns one of the most luxurious resorts on the East Coast. My mother is a beautiful and talented woman, and Daddy is more wonderful to me than my mysterious real father could ever have been, and, even though he's a brat, Jefferson is a cute little nine-year-old brother. Don't tell him I said so.<br><br>But, sometimes I can't drive away those sad feelings that sneak into my heart. It's as if there is always a dark cloud hovering, even though the rest of the sky is blue. I wish I could be more like you and always see the cheerful side of things. Mommy says you have bubbles in your blood.<br><br>Maybe I'm just being silly. Daddy says it's nonsense to believe in curses, but I can't help wondering if one wasn't put on our family. Look at the terrible thing Grandfather Cutler did to Grandmother Laura, and look at what Grandmother Cutler did to Mommy when she was just born. No wonder Aunt Clara Sue was so wild and died so young. I feel sorry for Grandmother Laura because she lives in a world of confusion as a result of all this.<br><br>People say all great families have tragedies and there's no reason to believe ours has been chosen for anything special. Yet, I can't help feeling there's something terrible waiting for me, too, a dark shadow just waiting to cast itself over me. Not all the music, all the lights, all the laughter and smiles can drive it away. It waits there, watching like some ugly, hunchbacked monster hatched in a nightmare.<br><br>I'm about to be sixteen and I still sleep with a small light on. I know I'm being ridiculous, but I can't help it. Only Gavin never laughs. He seems to know exactly what I mean. I see it in his dark eyes.<br><br>And you don't laugh at me, although you're always bawling me out for not smiling enough.<br><br>I promise, I'll try. I can't wait to see you. I can't wait to see everyone. It's going to be the greatest weekend of my life!<br><br>See, I bounce from one mood to another. No wonder Daddy calls me a ping-pong ball.<br><br>Aunt Trish, if you have a program from your new show, please bring it along. I'm so proud of you and I hope and pray that some day you will be just as proud of me.<br><br>Love,<br><br>Christie<br><br><b>Chapter 1: Sweet Sixteen</b><br><br>The thick layers of clouds that had blown in from the ocean overnight still hung in the sky when I woke early in the morning. I couldn't sleep late, not today, not the most special day of my life. I threw off my pink and white down comforter and practically leaped out of my pink polkadotted canopy bed to rush to the window and gaze out over the grounds between our house and the hotel. Most of the grounds staff were already out there trimming hedges, cutting grass and washing down walkways. Here and there, I saw a guest taking an early morning walk. Many of our guests had been coming to Cutler's Cove for years and years and were elderly.<br><br>Off to my right, the ocean looked as silver as coins and the seagulls could be seen hungrily swooping down to the beaches in search of breakfast. In the distance an ocean liner was nearly lost against the gray background. I had so wanted to wake up to a morning filled with sunshine. I wanted the sea to sparkle as it had never sparkled before, and I wanted the sunlight to stream through the petals of the roses, the daffodils, the tulips and turn the leaves of the trees into a rich spring green.<br>When I was very little, I used to dream that the hotel, the grounds, the beaches and ocean were my own private Wonderland into which I had fallen like Alice. I gave everything silly names and even pretended people I knew were animals dressed like people. Nussbaum the chef was an old lion and his nephew Leon, his assistant with the long neck, was a giraffe. The bellhops that scurried about were rabbits, and Mr. Dorfman who prowled about the hotel at all hours with his eyes wide looking for mistakes and inefficiency was a snooty owl. I would look up at the painting of Grandmother Cutler in the lobby and think of her as the wicked witch. Even Uncle Philip and Aunt Bet's twins, Richard and Melanie, who really did look alike, were afraid of Grandmother Cutler's picture and would try to scare each other, or me and Jefferson, by saying, "Grandmother Cutler will get you!"<br><br>Although Mommy had really never told me all the gruesome details, I knew she was treated horribly when she was brought back to Cutler's Cove. It seems impossible to me that anyone could have despised my beautiful, loving Mother. When I was little sometimes I would stare up at Grandmother Cutlet's portrait, trying to see in that lean, hard face the clues to her cruelty. When I walked past that portrait, her cold gray eyes always followed me and I had many a nightmare with her in it.<br><br>The picture of her husband, Grandfather Cutler, was different. He wore a sly smile, but one that made me look away just as quickly and make sure all my buttons were closed. I knew vaguely that he had done a very bad thing to Grandmother Laura Sue and as a result, Mommy had been born; but again, what exactly had happened had not yet been told to me. It was all part of the mysterious past, the somber and unhappy history of the Cutlers. So much of my heritage was kept under lock and key, buried in old documents stuffed away in iron boxes or sealed in photograph albums kept in dusty cartons somewhere in the attic of the hotel.<br><br>And there were fewer and fewer people working here who remembered Grandmother and Grandfather Cutler. Those who did remember never wanted to answer my questions and always said, "You should ask your mother, Christie. That's family business," as if family business were the code words for <i>top secret.</i> Our housekeeper Mrs. Boston had a stock reply whenever I asked her any questions. She had been Grandmother Cutler's housekeeper, but she always replied with, "It's better you don't know."<br><br>Why was it better? How bad could it have been? When was I going to be old enough to know? Daddy said it was too painful for Mommy to talk about any of it in great detail and would only bring back bad memories and make her cry.<br><br>"You don't want her to cry, do you?" he would ask me and I would shake my head and try to forget.<br><br>But it was impossible to forget a past that still lingered about in shadows and in between sentences, a past that suddenly could turn smiles into looks of sadness or fear, a past that called to me from the old paintings or from the tombstones on Randolph's and Aunt Clara Sue's graves in the old cemetery. Sometimes, it made me feel as if I were only half a person, as if I had yet to meet the other half of myself which would emerge someday from those dark shadows to introduce herself as the real Christie Longchamp.<br><br>Nothing made me feel this way more than knowing only scant details about my real father. I knew his name, Michael Sutton, and I knew from looking him up in the reference books in the school library that he was once a popular opera star who also sang in London and Broadway theater. His career had taken a very bad turn and he had disappeared from sight. Mommy wouldn't talk about him. She wouldn't tell me how they had fallen in love enough to have had me or why I never saw him. Whenever I asked, she would say, "Someday, I'll tell you all of it, Christie, when you're old enough to understand."<br><br>Oh, how I have always hated it when people said that to me. When would I ever be old enough to understand why grown-ups fell in and out of love, why they hated and hurt each other, why someone like Grandmother Laura Sue who was once young and beautiful, was now twisted and crippled and shrunken up inside? I knew early on that it wasn't my age that was the problem, it was that Mommy found the past too painful to talk about. I felt sorry for her but I had grown to feel sorry for myself, too. I had a right to know...to know who I was.<br><br>As I gazed out my window, I shivered and buttoned the top button of my pajama top because the June morning was as grey and chilly as my thoughts. Even the sparrows that usually pranced and paraded on the telephone wires outside my room seemed strangely quiet today. It was as if they knew it was my sixteenth birthday and wanted to see just how I would react to the dark skies. They fluttered their wings nervously, but remained squatting down, staring.<br><br>I frowned at them and folded my arms under my breasts, slouching my shoulders just the way Mommy hated. I couldn't help the way I felt. Daddy called me a weather vane.<br><br>"One look at your face," he said, "and I can tell whether it will be a nice day or not."<br><br>He was right. I was like a window pane, so easy to see through and read what was written inside. The weather always affected my moods. When it rained and rained, I wouldn't even look out the window. I would pretend it was nice outside and just ignore the pitter-patter of drops on the roof. But when the sunshine came pouring through my lace curtains and kissed my face, my eyes would pop open and I would spring out of bed as if sleep had been a prison and daylight was the key opening the heavy, iron door.<br><br>Mr. Wittleman, my piano teacher, said the same things about me. He deliberately chose a heavy piece, a Brahms; or Beethoven, to practice on dark, cloudy days, and something light or sweet, a Tchaikovsky or Liszt, on sunny days. He said my fingers must weigh ten pounds more whenever it rains.<br><br>"You should have been born a flower," he said, his heavy, dark brown eyebrows tilting inward. They were as thick as caterpillars. "The way you blossom and frown."<br><br>I knew he was teasing me, even though he didn't smile. He was a firm but tolerant man who tutored a number of young people in Cutler's Cove. He let me know in little ways that I was his most promising pupil. He told me he would tell Mommy that I should definitely audition for Juilliard in New York City.<br><br>I turned away from the window when I heard my little brother Jefferson come out of his room and down the corridor to mine. I watched expectantly for my door handle to turn slowly. He loved sneaking in while I was still asleep and then screaming and jumping on my bed, no matter how many times I bawled him out for it. I told Mommy that the cartoonist who made Dennis the Menace must have known Jefferson first.<br><br>This morning, since I was already up, I would surprise him. I saw the handle turn and the door opening little by little until Jefferson could tiptoe in. The moment his foot came through I grabbed the door and thrust it open.<br><br>"JEFFERSON!" I cried and he screamed and then laughed and charged to my bed, burying himself in my comforter. He was still in his pajamas, too. I slapped him firmly on the rump. "I told you to stop doing that. You have to learn to knock."<br><br>He poked his head out from under the comforter. Jefferson was so different from me. He was never depressed, never upset about the weather unless it prevented him from doing something he had planned to do. He could just as well play outside in a warm, light rain as he could play in sunshine. Once he was enveloped in his world of makebelieve, nothing mattered. It took Mrs. Boston four or five times to get him to hear her calling, and when he was interrupted, he would narrow those sapphire eyes of his into dark slits and scowl angrily. He had Daddy's temper and Daddy's eyes and build, but Mommy's mouth and nose. His hair was dark brown most of the year, but in the summer, maybe because he spent all his waking hours in the sun, his hair would lighten until it was almost the color of almonds.<br><br>"Today's your birthday," he declared, ignoring my complaints. "I'm supposed to give you sixteen pats on your backside and one for good luck."<br><br>"You are not. Who told you that?"<br><br>"Raymond Sanders."<br><br>"Well you just tell him to slap himself sixteen times. Get out of my bed and go back to your room so I can get dressed," I ordered. He sat up, folding the blanket over his lap, and peered at me with those dark, inquisitive eyes.<br><br>"What kind of presents do you think you will get? You will get hundreds and hundreds of presents. So many people are coming to your party," he added, his hands out, palms up.<br><br>"Jefferson, it's not polite to think about your presents. It's nice enough that all these people are coming, some from very far away. Now get out of here before I call Daddy," I said, pointing toward the door.<br><br>"Will you get a lot of toys?" he asked anxiously, his eyes filled with expectation.<br><br>"I hardly think so. I'm sixteen, Jefferson, not six."<br><br>He smirked. He always hated it when he got gifts of clothing on his birthdays instead of toys. He would tear open the boxes, gaze at the garments for an instant, and then go on to the next hopefully.<br><br>"Why is sixteen so important?" he demanded.<br><br>I brushed back my hair so it fell over my shoulders and sat at the foot of the bed.<br><br>"Because when a girl gets to be sixteen, people are supposed to treat her differently," I explained.<br><br>"How?" Jefferson was always full of questions, driving everyone crazy with his "Whys" and "Hows" and "Whats."<br><br>"They just do. They treat you more like an adult and not a child, or a baby like you."<br><br>"I'm not a baby," he protested. "I'm nine."<br><br>"You act like one, sneaking in on me every morning and screaming. Now go on, get dressed for breakfast," I said and stood up. "I've got to take a shower and pick out something to wear."<br><br>"When's Aunt Trisha coming?" he asked, instead of leaving. He would ask a thousand questions first.<br><br>"This afternoon, early."<br><br>"And Gavin?"<br><br>"About three or four o'clock. All right, Jefferson? Can ...</p><h2>Thanksgiving: The Biography of an American Holiday (Revisiting New England)</h2><p>In this, the first in-depth study of the most American of holidays, James Baker sweeps away lingering myths and misconceptions to show how this celebration day was born and grew to be an essential part of our national spirit. Thanksgiving: The Biography of an American Holiday opens with an overview of the popular mythos of the holiday before discussing its possible religious and cultural precedents. This classic Yankee holiday is examined in historical and contemporary detail that embraces everything from proclamations, sermons, and local and regional traditions to family reunions, turkey dinners, and recipes. Thanksgiving&#x2019;s evolving face is illustrated with charming and often revealing period prints that chart our changing attitudes: the influence of Victorian sentiment in Thanksgiving&#x2019;s development, Progressive utilitarianism, intellectual &#x201c;debunking,&#x201d; patriotic wartime reclamation, and 1960s-era protest. Thanksgiving remains controversial up to the present day, as Mayflower descendants, Native Americans, and commercial exploiters compete for the American public&#x2019;s opinion of the holiday&#x2019;s contemporary significance and its future status. This is an intelligent and illuminating introduction to a beloved holiday and a fascinating cultural history of America and Americana.</p><p><p>JAMES W. BAKER was the director of research at Plimoth Plantation for many years and has acted as an authority for numerous Thanksgiving Day exhibits, articles, newscasts, and children's books.</p>&#x201c;Baker has incorporated all the available research on Thanksgiving and enriched it with his unparalleled access to original sources as the former director of research at Plimoth Plantation. Most appealing about this book is that it has been produced by an expert on the topic, and one who is also a Plymouth, MA, native. He shows us how Thanksgiving is seen through each generation's reality, having morphed from a holiday for pilgrim hats and turkeys to a cause for Native American protests to a holy day to several ancient holidays combined and a full-scale orgy of food and football. Thanksgiving is not the holiday you think it is and will not be the holiday you know now in 100 years, but it can be whatever holiday you need. There is now a desire to make it an international holiday-Who knows? . . . . This is destined to become the accepted text for research on the history and myth of this most American holiday, and it will be an enjoyable, fascinating read both for students and for anyone looking for a good story.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i><b>Booklist</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;Baker traces how the [Thanksgiving] celebration has changed over the years. In the 18th century, Thanksgiving was viewed as a day for family reunions, and the Pilgrims were remembered as the symbolic founders of New England. But the connection between the two had been lost by the time George Washington issued the first presidential Thanksgiving proclamation in 1789. . . Baker notes that the struggle over the significance of the Thanksgiving holiday continues, with historical accuracy often the victim of political advantage. But, he argues, &#x2018;the holiday&#x2019;s cultural vigor is actually demonstrated by the conflicts and debates that surround it.&#x2019; For, he observes, &#x2018;debate indicates relevance, and the dispute over the appropriate role of Thanksgiving in American life demonstrates that the holiday is very much alive and still evolving.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014;<i><b>Boston Globe</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;James Baker, a former researcher at Plimoth Plantation in Massachusetts, does not wag a scholar&#x2019;s dour finger at what has become a turkey-and-football jamboree. But in his comprehensive and readable history of the holiday, he does remind us that Thanksgiving is more than &#x2018;ubiquitous, mass-produced images of buckle-hatted Pilgrims, generic Indians, turkeys, pumpkins, and cornstalks.&#x2019; For the Puritans aboard the Mayflower, Thanksgiving was a religious service to acknowledge God&#x2019;s providence. Its focus was prayer, not festivity. And while the Massachusetts Pilgrims did celebrate a harvest holiday in fall 1621 with friendly Wampanoags, Baker argues that this landmark event &#x2018;meets none of the qualifications for an orthodox Thanksgiving.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014;<i><b>Washington Post</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;[A] thorough and readable history. . . . The actual purpose of this book is to prove once again that one of the nation&#x2019;s beloved holidays is an &#x2018;invented tradition,&#x2019; discontinuous in its history and varied in the types of ways it has been celebrated. Baker examines a vast range of cultural materials from postcards to children&#x2019;s books to Hollywood films of the 1990s. There is evidence about how people actually celebrate this holiday, but it is not as important as the theme of myth-making and contested history. Baker demonstrates the commonsense; not just that myths take on a life of their own but that in speaking to &#x2018;hopes and fears,&#x2019; myths are much more emotionally satisfying than truths.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i><b>Journal of Social History</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;James W. Baker has given a lucid and interesting account of the Thanksgiving holiday. Baker also does well in placing the Thanksgiving holiday in its historical context. He shows how Thanksgiving took on new meaning during larger events such as the Revolutionary War, Industrial Revolution, Civil War, Great Depression, World War II, and the Civil Rights movement. Furthermore, he exposes the myths that most of us are taught about Thanksgiving from youth, but does so with a balanced approach. His aim is historical accuracy, not moral judgment. I recommend this book to any interested in American history, the Pilgrims, or the Thanksgiving holiday.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i><b>Historical Journal of Massachusetts</b></i><br><br>Well written and nicely illustrated, this most extensive treatment of Thanksgiving&#x2019;s cultural history to date is a significant contribution to American studies . . .

After years of study, reproduction, and teaching, the author shares his expertise as each technique is simply described, step by step, with a color illustration for each move. What at first seems like a complicated craft becomes pleasantly clear as each step is built upon the one just completed.</p><p>Gerald Findley spent many years studying, reproducing, and teaching the art of fingerweaving. He has had a life long interest in learning and teaching crafts including basketry, braiding, bead work, tablet weaving, inkle loom weaving, and wood carving. His interest in crafts led him to become a Scoutmaster for the Boy Scouts of America. While Ceremony Team Advisor for his local troop, due to lack of published material on fingerweaving he began a series of drawings and crafted actual pieces to help team members create their own costumes. He has woven and donated for use by members of the Order of the Arrow Ceremony team over 30 sets of finger-woven pieces.Fingerweaving has been practiced by Native Americans for centuries. It requires no sophisticated loom, only the nimble hands of the weaver. Each technique is presented in detail. The instructions are simple and clearly written, and each step is illustrated with color drawings that make the different threads easy to identify. Includes a color photo of each finished weaving. The approach used here makes this craft much more accessible to amateurs who may have wanted to try it but may have been turned off by the complexity of other books on the subject.

In this highly original book by journalist Warren Berger, in collaboration with celebrated designer Bruce Mau, ten groundbreaking principles of design are shown in action-addressing business, social, and personal challenges and improving the way we think, work, and live.<br><br> <i>Glimmer</i> takes readers on a journey through today's fascinating world of design, where the formerly distinct disciplines of graphic, product, and social design are undergoing "smart recombinations." In the cutting-edge studios of Mau and other visionaries, everything is ripe for reinvention-including the ways businesses function, children learn, and communities thrive. Designers are solving problems at an unprecedented pace today by using improved technology and the highly practical design principles described in this book, such as "Ask stupid questions," "Make hope visible," "Work the metaphor," "Embrace constraints," and "Begin anywhere." <i>Glimmer</i> inspires readers to apply these same principles to their own life challenges.<br><br> While celebrated designers work on re-creating the world, Berger reveals the growing grassroots "glimmer movement" in which everyday people are emerging as designers and problem solvers. Readers will be fascinated by how "transformation design" is reinventing companies and addressing thorny social problems. Berger shares stories of how burned fingers, wrenched backs, and mixed-up pills all led to ingenious new product designs.<br><br> In a time of anxiety and retrenchment, this hopeful yet hardheaded book illuminates "the glimmer of possibility and potential-that first spark of an innovative idea or a life-changing plan." According to Berger, "This faint light is all around us and also within us, if we can learn to recognize and nurture it." The best designers already know how to transform that glimmer of possibility into the steady glow of creation and innovation-and with the inspiration of <i>Glimmer</i>, we're now all able to do the same. <br> <strong> Amazon Exclusive: What Can We Learn from the World&#x2019;s Greatest Designers?</strong> <p> </p><p> The answer to the above question is "a lot." We can learn how to solve problems better. How to look at the world around us with a fresh eye. How to think more creatively, and ultimately, how to open up new possibilities in our lives. </p> <p> These are the things that great designers do every day. But the premise in my new book Glimmer is: "You don't have to be a designer to think like one." There's a whole way of thinking used by designers, and a step-by-step process they follow, that really can be embraced by anyone&#x2014;whether you're in business, out there trying to contribute to the world in some way, or if you're just looking to improve your own life. </p> <p> What I found, in studying some of the world's most innovative designers, is that&#x2014;in addition to being immensely talented and bright people, of course&#x2014;they tend to have two big things they rely on. First, they have a certain mindset that enables them to be fearless and optimistic and open to all kinds of new possibilities. And second, they have a framework they use&#x2014;a proven methodology that helps them to bring their ideas and plans to life, to get things done, and to be successful. I sort of dejargonize this methodology and give lots of examples of how it works in Glimmer.</p> <p> One of the things designers are known for doing is questioning everything. In fact there's a joke that asks, "How many designers does it take to change a lightbulb?" To which the answer is: "Does it have to be a lightbulb?"</p> <p> It's a joke, but it's not: Designers all the time really do ask basic things like Does it have to be a lightbulb? The design process often begins with questioning the conventional wisdom about how we currently do things. </p> <p> Of course, it's one thing to question the world around you-but it's much harder to begin to change it. As I write in Glimmer, if you just question everything without trying to improve it, you may end up being more of a whiner than a designer. Designers actually must take action in order to create new possibilities&#x2014;that's their job. And so it's not surprising they've developed proven methods to help them do that. </p> <p> I examine those methods in detail in the book, but they involve, for example:</p> <ul> <p></p><li> Teaching oneself to be open to new ideas by "thinking laterally" (which is really about tricking your brain into moving in unexpected directions, instead of the usual straightforward ones).<p></p> </li> <p></p><li> Developing a better antenna for figuring out what's missing &amp; what's really needed in the world around you&#x2014;that's how designers find great opportunities.<p></p></li> <p></p><li> Learning how to bring ideas to life, and make them real. All of us have ideas in our heads, but designers make their ideas real and tangible-by sketching, by modeling, by scotch-taping things together. It's what designers call prototyping, and it's the way you take a dream and gradually build it into a reality. And this is a technique anyone can use.<p></p></li> <p></p><li> Another important thing designers do is, they "fail forward." Most of us are afraid to fail, but designers fail every day. What they understand is that every failure&#x2014;if you know how to react to it and use it&#x2014;can be a critical step that brings you closer to the end goal.<p></p></li> </ul> <p> These are just a few of the basic tools and principles designers use. And what really surprised me, as I worked on the book, was to see just how accessible these tools are to anyone. And how applicable they are to just about any situation.</p> <p> In today's world, with all the challenges and problems we have to grapple with&#x2014;both in our daily lives and in the world at large&#x2014;we can benefit from having that designer mindset and methodology. Because the truth is, we all need to become better at facing up to tough challenges and finding new solutions. </p>After years of writing articles about creativity and advertising, I decided to set out to find a good answer to the fundamental question: "What is design?" Design is a fascinating subject in that everybody's interested in it, but very few have a clear understanding of what it is and how it works. I found out there are as many definitions as there are designers. Yet after talking to hundreds of creatives, I also found there are some universal principles for creativity and innovation from which we all can learn. These principles transformed the way <i>I </i>work and approach problem-solving, and will do the same for you.</p><h2>Artists and Amateurs: Etching in Eighteenth-Century France</h2><p>Over the course of the 18th century a great number of artists, ranging from established painters and sculptors to amateurs, experimented with etching, an accessible form of printmaking akin to drawing. In a period when artists strained to navigate the highly regulated Acad�mie Royale and the increasingly discordant public spheres of the marketplace and the Salon, etching afforded them stylistic freedom and allowed them to produce exquisite works of art in a spirit of collaboration and experimentation.<br><br>Featuring works by Watteau, Boucher, Fragonard, Hubert Robert, and many others, <i>Artists and Amateurs </i>embarks on a fresh exploration of how etching flourished in ancien r�gime France, shedding new light on artistic practice and patronage at that time.

"</b><p>This was the new metropolitan disease Trollope set out brilliantly to expose in <i>The Way We Live Now</i>. His milieux are the City's financial institutions, London's exclusive West End squares and drones' clubs populated by languorous aristocrats, all offering rich pickings for the unscrupulous speculator, whether in the marriage or the money market. Among the unscrupulous are the hack-writer Lady Carbury, her son Felix and, above all, Melmotte, a financier of uncertain origins and Napoleonic ruthlessness, energy and charm, whose dramatic rise and fall dominates the novel.</p><p><i>The Way We Live Now</i>, unpopular on its first appearance in 1874-5, is now widely recognized as Trollope's masterpiece. An unorthodox satire with a happy ending, it explores decadence and change in what Frank Kermode calls "a world increasingly more congenial to the speculator than to the gentleman."</p><p>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

"He wrote for the day, the moment; but these are just the writers whom posterity is apt to put into its pocket." Considered by contemporary critics to be Trollope's greatest novel, The Way We Live Now is a satire of the literary world of London in the 1870s and a bold indictment of the new power of speculative finance in English life. "I was instigated by what I conceived to be the commercial profligacy of the age," Trollope said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; His story concerns Augustus Melmotte, a French swindler and scoundrel, and his daughter, to whom Felix Carbury, adored son of the authoress Lady Carbury, is induced to propose marriage for the sake of securing a fortune. Trollope knew well the difficulties of dealing with editors, publishers, reviewers, and the public; his portrait of Lady Carbury, impetuous, unprincipled, and unswervingly devoted to her own self-promotion, is one of his finest satirical achievements.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; His picture of late nineteenth century England is of a society on the verge of moral bankruptcy, where the traditional virtues of Tory squirearchy, represented by Roger Carbury, prove to be no match for the financial genius of Augustus Melmotte. In The Way We Live Now Trollope combines his talents as a portraitist and his skills as a storyteller to give us life as it was lived more than a hundred years ago.</p><h2>Recognizing and Treating Breathing Disorders: A Multidisciplinary Approach (The Leon Chaitow Library of Bodywork and Movement Therapies)</h2><p>This authoritative, research-based book, written by a team of clinical experts, offers an introduction to the symptoms and causes of disordered breathing as well as the strategies and protocols that can be used to correct and restore normal breathing.

Despite its relatively narrow focus, it is chock full of the pearls of clinical wisdom that students and practitioners treasure, and many of these lessons apply to medicine in general. The book was well characterized by a reviewer of an earlier edition for <em>The New England Journal of Medicine:</em> "If only one book about surgery could be made available to physicians from all specialties, it should probably be Silen's recent revision of <em>Cope's Early Diagnosis of the Acute Abdomen</em>. Since the book first appeared more than 30 years ago, it has remained the classic treatise on the initial approach to abdominal pain." Because acute, severe abdominal pain is still a common problem whose misdiagnosis can result in quick death, each generation of beginning physicians is faced with the urgency of learning to make a diagnosis in this high anxiety situation and they appreciate the wise, humane, precisely detailed guidance offered by Cope and Silen. For the <em>21st Edition</em>, Dr. Silen has again updated the text in a respectful but significant way. He has strengthened its emphasis on pitfalls in the interpretation of CT and ultrasound scans, on misadventures caused by over-reliance on blood tests and radiographs, and on careful history-taking to avoid the costs of inappropriate lab tests. He has also reviewed the data from a randomized clinical trial indicating that patients should receive adequate analgesia while awaiting a definitive diagnosis, a dictum that is contrary to traditional teaching.</p><p>William Silen is Johnson and Johnson Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Surgery at Harvard Medical School.<br>"The book provides a wealth of clinical information and experience and is a pelasure to read for its concise, crisp style and historical context."--<em>Doody's Book Review Service</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences, Solutions Manual</h2><p>Updates the original, comprehensive introduction to the areas of mathematical physics encountered in advanced courses in the physical sciences.

S�ren Kierkegaard's remarkable combination of genius and peculiarity made this a fair if arrogant prediction. But Kierkegaard's life has been notoriously hard to study, so complex was the web of fact and fiction in his work. Joakim Garff's biography of Kierkegaard is thus a landmark achievement. A seamless blend of history, philosophy, and psychological insight, all conveyed with novelistic verve, this is the most comprehensive and penetrating account yet written of the life and works of the enigmatic Dane who changed the course of intellectual history.</p><br><p> Garff portrays Kierkegaard not as the all-controlling impresario behind some of the most important works of modern philosophy and religious thought--books credited with founding existentialism and prefiguring postmodernism--but rather as a man whose writings came to control him. Kierkegaard saw himself as a vessel for his writings, a tool in the hand of God, and eventually as a martyr singled out to call for the end of "Christendom." Garff explores the events and relationships that formed Kierkegaard, including his guilt-ridden relationship with his father, his rivalry with his brother, and his famously tortured relationship with his fianc�e Regine Olsen. He recreates the squalor and splendor of Golden Age Copenhagen and the intellectual milieu in which Kierkegaard found himself increasingly embattled and mercilessly caricatured.</p><br><p> Acclaimed as a major cultural event on its publication in Denmark in 2000, this book, here presented in an exceptionally crisp and elegant translation, will be the definitive account of Kierkegaard's life for years to come.</p></p><p><b>Joakim Garff</b> is Associate Professor at the S�ren Kierkegaard Research Center at the University of Copenhagen. He is the author of numerous books and articles and is the coeditor of a project to publish definitive new Danish-language editions of all of Kierkegaard's writings. <b>Bruce H. Kirmmse</b> is Professor of History at Connecticut College. His previous works include <i>Kierkegaard in Golden Age Denmark</i> and <i>Encounters with Kierkegaard</i> (Princeton). He is the chairman of the editorial board of <i>Kierkegaard's Journals and Notebooks</i> (Princeton, forthcoming).For many, the mention of S�ren Kierkegaard (1813-1855) brings to mind a Danish thinker faintly recalled from dim memories of an introductory philosophy class. For others, the name is immediately associated with existentialism and phrases such as "subjectivity as truth" and "leap of faith." <p> Few philosophers have gained more fame for positions they seldom embraced than Kierkegaard. In the history of philosophy, he has been portrayed as an anti-Hegelian, the "father of existentialism" and the precursor of deconstruction.</p><p> Even today, many interpreters limit their readings of Kierkegaard to his perceived antipathy to Georg W.F. Hegel, the German philosopher who constructed a complex, sometimes torturous philosophical system that declared that truth could be reached only by using reason and objectivity. His writings seemed distant, abstract and removed from the real world. Kierkegaard, by contrast, proclaimed that each person was engaged in an individual quest for truth in the stages along life's way. While their approaches to truth indeed differ substantially, Kierkegaard never thought of himself as an anti-Hegelian, and he praised some of Hegel's readings as much as he criticized others. The real difference between the two is Kierkegaard's lively, poetic writing style as against Hegel's more formal, turgid style.</p><p> In the middle of the 20th century, the existentialists Sartre and Camus embraced Kierkegaard as one of their own.Near the dawn of the 21st century, Jacques Derrida and some deconstructionists have, in turn, claimed Kierkegaard as their darling.</p><p>Kierkegaard certainly would have welcomed such attention in his own lifetime. But, as this brilliant new biography by Joakim Garff makes clear, he never thought of himself as a philosopher. One look at his journals makes it clear that he considered himself primarily a poet and, later in life, a preacher. The works that have become classics -- Fear and Trembling, Sickness Unto Death, Either-Or -- offer not a formal philosophical system like Kant's or Hegel's but the reflections of an artist using irony and humor to work out his own struggles with writing and life.</p><p> Born the seventh child of merchant Michael Kierkegaard and his wife, Ane, in the depression years in early 19th-century Copenhagen, S�ren had by age 8 demonstrated his precociousness by memorizing the Lutheran catechism and completing enough preliminary instruction to enter the Danish Civic Virtue School. As a teenager, he became fascinated with mystery stories and wrote his own "true-crime" thrillers. Captivated by his readings of Goethe's Faust, Kierkegaard even tried his hand at writing his own version of that story. These early experiments paved the way for his later, fully realized efforts. After he completed his dissertation on the role of irony in the work of Socrates and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling(The Concept of Irony) in 1841, Kierkegaard went on to write three of his most famous works (Either-Or, Fear and Trembling, and Repetition) in 1843; he wrote all of his major works between 1843 and 1848.</p><p> In minute and sometimes exhausting detail, Garff, an associate professor at the S�ren Kierkegaard Research Center in Copenhagen, provides a year-by-year account of Kierkegaard's life and work. He traces his subject's early schooling and his immersion in Greek and Latin, his theological work at university, his failed romance with with his former fianc�e, Regine Olsen, his sometimes difficult relations with his siblings and parents, his attacks on critics (and their attacks on him), and the circumstances in which he wrote his books.</p><p> Garff immediately points out the difficulties of his project: "To the dismay of the biographer, Kierkegaard cannot be pursued 'historically.' He has left nothing behind but fragments and scattered traces, and from the very first moment he put pen to paper, he adopted free, fictionalized production as his preferred mode." To make the biographer's task even more difficult, Kierkegaard's journals are not entirely reliable, for his entries "waver between reality and the artistic reproduction of reality." For Garff, however, this "mystification, mummery, and fiction are constitutive features in Kierkegaard's production of himself." </p><p>More astutely, Garff reads Kierkegaard as he himself wanted to be read: as a poet. "For Kierkegaard, time was writing. The idea for which he was willing to live and die was in fact the production of dazzling literary work." Garff points out that the literary characters that most influenced Kierkegaard were Don Juan (representing pleasure), Faust (doubt) and the Wandering Jew (despair), and that he used characters based on them in his writings. For example, both Don Juan and Faust personify the demonic in Kierkegaard's Either-Or, Part One.</p><p> Kierkegaard's aesthetic sensibility also plays an enormous role in his broken relationship with Olsen. Many critics have speculated that Kierkegaard's breakup with her arose from some sexual misunderstanding or from his sexual insecurity. In Garff's view, Kierkegaard's letters to her were not declarations of love and devotion but an opportunity for him to hone his writing skills. Kierkegaard, Garff argues, simply thought he would be better at being a writer than being a husband. His aestheticism also explains his predilection for pseudonymns. With very few exceptions, he published little under his own name. Instead, he attributed many of his works TO "authors" who represent aspects of HIS personality. "I always stand in an altogether poetic relation to my works; therefore I am pseudonymous," he noted in a journal entry. "Whenever a book develops something, the appropriate individuality is delineated." </p><p>But Garff is mainly interested in finding Kierkegaard and his mythmaking self behind the writings. He offers little in the way of critical readings of the works. In addition, he neglects to show how deeply Kierkegaard influenced philosophy and theology in the 20th century, when his writings garnered more attention than during his life.</p><p> Such minor flaws do not mar the singular beauty of Garff's prose, masterfully translated by Bruce Kirmmse, or his brilliant insights into the enigmatic life of Kierkegaard. The appearance of Garff's biography in English -- it was published in Denmark in 2000 -- is a momentous occasion in Kierkegaard scholarship. Garff pursues a literary approach rather than an intellectual one, drawing deeply not only on the archives but also on Kierkegaard's newly translated Journals and Notebooks, which will begin to appear this fall. He provides a dazzling account of Kierkegaard's comings and goings, his anxieties and hopes, and, above all, his invention of himself as the Kierkegaard that both his time and ours have come to know. </p><p>Reviewed by Henry Carrigan <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

Each of the species is given thorough botanical description, including various aspects of its morphology &#x2014; size, shape, form of culms, blades, panicles, spikes, and flowers &#x2014; and height, proper planting season, and range of distribution are noted. The <i>Manual</i> also outlines the common uses to which grasses are put and discusses in general terms their distribution, classification, nomenclature, and common names. The 1,199 drawings make identification of any grass species found in the United States a virtual certainty. The appended synonymy of alternate names for each species provides an authoritative taxonomy, eliminating confusion.<br>The nature lover with no more technical equipment than a keen eye can use this manual with profit, for a glossary of botanical terms is included. Naturalists, botanists, agriculturists, and horticulturists will find it valuable as a field and research guide to virtually all the grasses that grow in this country.</p><p></p><h2>Linear Algebra and Its Applications</h2><p>An undergraduate-level text which challenges the student throughout with the development of topics in linear algebra.

Joan of Arc was born to Jacques d'Arc and Isabelle Rom�e, a peasant family, at Domr�my in north-east France. Joan said she received visions of the Archangel Michael, Saint Margaret, and Saint Catherine of Alexandria instructing her to support Charles VII and recover France from English domination late in the Hundred Years' War. The uncrowned King Charles VII sent Joan to the siege of Orl�ans as part of a relief mission. She gained prominence after the siege was lifted only nine days later. Several additional swift victories led to Charles VII's coronation at Reims. This long-awaited event boosted French morale and paved the way for the final French victory.</p><p></p><h2>One Kitten for Kim</h2><p>When Kim&#39;s cat has kittens, his parents tell him that he may only keep one and must find homes for all the others.

From the extraordinarily detailed records kept by Florentine tax collectors and the equally precise <i>ricordanze</i> (household accounts with notations of events great and small), Klapisch-Zuber draws a living picture of the Tuscan household. We learn, for example, how children were named, how wet nurses were engaged, how marriages were negotiated and celebrated. A wealth of other sources are tapped&#x2014;including city statutes, private letters, philosophical works on marriage, paintings&#x2014;to determine the social status of women. Klapisch-Zuber reveals how women, in their roles as daughters, wives, sisters, and mothers, were largely subject to a family system that needed them but valued them little. <br></p><p><b>Lydia G.

The text begins with a review and critique of the major theoretical approaches: psychoanalysis, behaviorism, humanism, cognitivism, eclecticism, structuralism and postmodernism. The authors then discuss the key assumptions underlying these theories - knowing, determinism, reductionism and science. They trace the intellectual history of these assumptions and offer contrasting options. The book concludes by examining ways of coming to terms with some of the inadequacies in the assumptions of the behavioral sciences.</p><p>Richard N.

The text can be used to accommodate a variety of scheduling and program requirements. Some suggestions follow: </p><p> Option 1: A two-term dc/ac sequence should allow sufficient time to cover all or most of the topics in the book. Chapters 1 through 7 can be covered in the first term and Chapters 8 through 15 in the second term. </p><p> Option 2: A modification of Option 1 is to add the coverage of capacitors through Section 9-5 and inductors through Section 11-5 to the first term do course. </p><p> Option 3: Yet another modification to Option 1 for those who prefer to cover reactive components before covering reactive circuits is to cover Chapter 11 on inductors immediately after Chapter 9 on capacitors. Then follow with Chapter 10, Chapter 12, and so on. </p><p> Option 4: A one-term do/ac sequence. Obviously, this approach will require selective and faster-paced coverage of much of the material. Since program requirements vary greatly, it is difficult to make specific suggestions for selective coverage. TO THE STUDENT </p><p> Any career training requires hard work, and electronics is no exception. The best way to learn new material is by reading, thinking, and doing. This text is designed to help you along the way by providing an overview and objectives for each section, numerous worked-out examples, practice exercises, and review questions with answers. </p><p> Don't expect every concept to be crystal clear after a single reading. Read each section of the text carefully and think about what you have read. Work through the example problems step-by-step before trying the related problem that goes with the example. Sometimes more than one reading of a section will be necessary. After each section, check your understanding by answering the section review questions. </p><p> Review the chapter summary and equation list. Take the multiple-choice selftest. Finally, work the problems at the end of the chapter. Check your answers to the self-test at the end of the chapter and the odd-numbered problems against those provided at the end of the book. Working problems is the most important way to check your comprehension and solidify concepts. CAREERS IN ELECTRONICS </p><p> The field of electronics is very diverse, and career opportunities are available in many areas. Because electronics is currently found in so many different applications and new technology is being developed at a fast rate, its future appears limitless. There is hardly an area of our lives that is not enhanced to some degree by electronics technology. Those who acquire a sound, basic knowledge of electrical and electronic principles and are willing to continue learning will always be in demand. </p><p> The importance of obtaining a thorough understanding of the basic principles contained in this text cannot be overemphasized. Most employers prefer to hire people who have both a thorough grounding in the basics and the ability and eagerness to grasp new concepts and techniques. If you have a good training in the basics, an employer will train you in the specifics of the job to which you are assigned. </p><p> There are many types of job classifications for which a person with training in electronics technology may qualify. A few of the most common job functions are discussed briefly in the following paragraphs. </p><p> Service Shop Technician: Technical personnel in this category are involved in the repair or adjustment of both commercial and consumer electronic equipment that is returned to the dealer or manufacturer for service.

Peter Calthorpe shows us what is possible using real world examples of innovative design strategies and forward-thinking policies that are already changing the way we live.<br> &nbsp;<br> This provocative and engaging work emerges from Calthorpe&#x2019;s belief that, just as the last fifty years produced massive changes in our culture, economy and environment, the next fifty will generate changes of an even more profound nature. The book, enhanced by its superb four-color graphics, is a call to action and a road map for moving forward.</p><p>In this groundbreaking new work,&nbsp;designer and sustainability innovator Peter Calthorpe&nbsp;shows how such regionally scaled urbanism can be combined with green technology to achieve not only needed reductions in carbon emissions but other critical economies and lifestyle benefits.Peter Calthorpe is a leading innovator in sustainable design, planning, and development.

One of the greatest living literary critics, his works include LOVE AND DEATH IN THE AMERICAN NOVEL (1960), AN END TO INNOCENCE (1955); NUDE CROQUET (1969), and FREAKS (1978).Chapter I<br><br>Mine ear is open, and my heart prepared; The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold:&#x2014; Say, is my kingdom lost? Richard II, III.ii. 93&#x2013;95.<br><br>It was a feature peculiar to the colonial wars of North America, that the toils and dangers of the wilderness were to be encountered, before the adverse hosts could meet. A wide, and, apparently, an impervious boundary of forests, severed the possessions of the hostile provinces of France and England. The hardy colonist, and the trained European who fought at his side, frequently expended months in struggling against the rapids of the streams, or in effecting the rugged passes of the mountains, in quest of an opportunity to exhibit their courage in a more martial conflict. But, emulating the patience and self-denial of the practised native warriors, they learned to overcome every difficulty; and it would seem, that in time, there was no recess of the woods so dark, nor any secret place so lovely, that it might claim exemption from the inroads of those who had pledged their blood to satiate their vengeance, or to uphold the cold and selfish policy of the distant monarchs of Europe.<br><br>Perhaps no district, throughout the wide extent of the intermediate frontiers, can furnish a livelier picture of the cruelty and fierceness of the savage warfare of those periods, than the country which lies between the head waters of the Hudson and the adjacent lakes.<br><br>The facilities which nature had there offered to the march of the combatants, were too obvious to be neglected. The lengthened sheet of the Champlain stretched from the frontiers of Canada, deep within the borders of the neighbouring province of New-York, forming a natural passage across half the distance that the French were compelled to master in order to strike their enemies. Near its southern termination, it received the contributions of another lake, whose waters were so limpid, as to have been exclusively selected by the Jesuit missionaries, to perform the typical purification of baptism, and to obtain for it the title of the lake &#x201c;du Saint Sacrement.&#x201d; The less zealous English thought they conferred a sufficient honour on its unsullied fountains, when they bestowed the name of their reigning prince, the second of the House of Hanover. The two united to rob the untutored possessors of its wooded scenery of their native right to perpetuate its original appellation of &#x201c;Horican.&#x201d;*<br><br>Winding its way among countless islands, and imbedded in mountains, the &#x201c;holy lake&#x201d; extended a dozen leagues still farther to the south. With the high plain that there interposed itself to the further passage of the water, commenced a portage of as many miles, which conducted the adventurer to the banks of the Hudson, at a point, where, with the usual obstructions of the rapids, or rifts, as they were then termed in the language of the country, the river became navigable to the tide.<br><br>While, in the pursuit of their daring plans of annoyance, the restless enterprise of the French even attempted the distant and difficult gorges of the Alleghany, it may easily be imagined that their proverbial acuteness would not overlook the natural advantages of the district we have just described. It became, emphatically, the bloody arena, in which most of the battles for the mastery of the colonies were contested. Forts were erected at the different points that commanded the facilities of the route, and were taken and retaken, rased and rebuilt, as victory alighted on the hostile banners. While the husbandmen shrunk back from the dangerous passes, within the safer boundaries of the more ancient settlements, armies larger than those that had often disposed of the sceptres of the mother countries, were seen to bury themselves in these forests, whence they rarely returned but in skeleton bands, that were haggard with care, or dejected by defeat. Though the arts of peace were unknown to this fatal region, its forests were alive with men; its glades and glens rang with the sounds of martial music, and the echoes of its mountains threw back the laugh, or repeated the wanton cry, of many a gallant and reckless youth, as he hurried by them, in the noontide of his spirits, to slumber in a long night of forgetfulness.<br><br>* As each nation of the Indians had either its language or its dialect, they usually gave different names to the same places, though nearly all of their appellations were descriptive of the object. Thus, a literal translation of the name of this beautiful sheet of water, used by the tribe that dwelt on its banks, would be &#x201c;The tail of the Lake.&#x201d; Lake George, as it is vulgarly, and now indeed legally, called, forms a sort of tail to Lake Champlain, when viewed on the map.

It follows the changes in the film industry with the arrival of sound motion pictures and the Great Depression, when black performers such as Stepin Fetchit and Bill "Bojangles" Robinson began finding a place in Hollywood. More often than not, they were saddled with rigidly stereotyped roles, but some gifted performers, most notably Hattie McDaniel in <i>Gone With the Wind</i> (1939), were able to turn in significant performances.<br><br>In the coming decades, more black talents would light up the screen. Dorothy Dandridge became the first African American to earn a Best Actress Oscar nomination for <i>Carmen Jones </i>(1954), and Sidney Poitier broke ground in films like <i>The Defiant Ones</i> and<i> </i>1963's <i>Lilies of the Field</i>. <i>Hollywood Black</i> reveals the changes in images that came about with the evolving social and political atmosphere of the US, from the Civil Rights era to the Black Power movement. The story takes readers through <i>Blaxploitation</i>, with movies like <i>Shaft</i> and <i>Super Fly</i>, to the emergence of such stars as Cicely Tyson, Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, and Whoopi Goldberg, and of directors Spike Lee and John Singleton.<br><br>The history comes into the new millennium with filmmakers Barry Jenkins (<i>Moonlight</i>), Ava Du Vernay (<i>Selma</i>),<i> </i>and Ryan Coogler (<i>Black Panther</i>); megastars such as Denzel Washington, Will Smith, and Morgan Freeman; as well as Halle Berry, Angela Bassett, Viola Davis, and a glorious gallery of others.<br><br>Filled with evocative photographs and stories of stars and filmmakers on set and off, <i>Hollywood Black </i>tells an underappreciated history as it's never before been told.</p><p><b>Donald Bogle</b> is one of the foremost authorities on African Americans in films and entertainment history.

But if you read only two in your life, these are the ones. Taken together, they form a couple of accessible and charming explanations of geometry and physics for the curious non-mathematician. <i>Flatland</i>, which is also available under separate cover, was published in 1880 and imagines a two-dimensional world inhabited by sentient geometric shapes who think their planar world is all there is. But one Flatlander, a Square, discovers the existence of a third dimension and the limits of his world's assumptions about reality and comes to understand the confusing problem of higher dimensions. The book is also quite a funny satire on society and class distinctions of Victorian England. The further mathematical fantasy, <i>Sphereland</i>, published 60 years later, revisits the world of Flatland in time to explore the mind-bending theories created by Albert Einstein, whose work so completely altered the scientific understanding of space, time, and matter. Among Einstein's many challenges to common sense were the ideas of curved space, an expanding universe and the fact that light does not travel in a straight line. Without use of the mathematical formulae that bar most non-scientists from an understanding of Einstein's theories, <i>Sphereland</i> gives lay readers ways to start comprehending these confusing but fundamental questions of our reality.Edwin Abbott Abbott (1838-1926) has been ranked as one of the leading scholars and theologians of the Victorian era. He received highest honors in mathematics, classics, and theology at St. John's College, Cambridge, and in 1862 began a brilliant career, during which he served as schoolmaster of some of England's outstanding schools. At the same time he distinguished himself as a scholar, and in 1889 he retired to his studies. Although <em>Flatland, a literary jeu d'esprit,</em> has given pleasure to thousands of readers over many generations, Abbott is best known for his scholarly works, especially his <em>Shakespearian Grammar </em>and his life of Francis Bacon, and for a number of theological discussions.</p><h2>War And Peace (Greenwich House Classics Library)</h2><p>The monumental Russian classic reflects the life and times of Russian society during the Napoleonic War</p><p>Count Leo Nikolayevich Tolstoy was born in 1828. He wrote THE SEBASTOPOL SKETCHES in 1855-6, WAR AND PEACE in 1865-8, ANNA KARENINA in 1874-6 and A CONFESSION in 1879-82. He died in 1910.

A. Milne was also the author of numerous dramas, essays, and novels for adults &#x2014; among them, this droll and finely crafted whodunit.<br>In it, Milne takes readers to the Red House, a comfortable residence in the placid English countryside that is the bachelor home of Mr. Mark Ablett. While visiting this cozy retreat, amateur detective Anthony Gillingham and his chum, Bill Beverley, investigate their genial host's disappearance and its connection with a mysterious shooting. Was the victim, whose body was found after a heated exchange with the host, shot in an act of self-defense? If so, why did the host flee, and if not, what drove him to murder?<br>Between games of billiards and bowls, the taking of tea, and other genteel pursuits, Gillingham and Beverley explore the possibilities in a light-hearted series of capers involving secret passageways, underwater evidence, and other atmospheric devices.<br>Sparkling with witty dialogue, deft plotting, and an intriguing cast of characters, this rare gem will charm mystery lovers, Anglophiles, and general readers alike.</p><p>Alan Alexander Milne was born in Hampstead in 1882 and attended an independent school run by his father before studying mathematics at Cambridge. After university he worked as an Assistant Editor at the magazine Punch and established himself as a successful author of both plays and novels, including The Red House Mystery until, with the publication of When We Were Very Young in 1924 and Winnie-the-Pooh in 1926 his career took a very different turn. Milne continued to produce works for adults but occasionally resented the success of his children&#39;s stories, which overshadowed much of his other work. In 1952 A. A. Milne suffered a stroke after brain surgery and retired to his country home in Sussex as an invalid. He died there four years later.Though Milne is immediately associated with Winnie-the-Pooh and pals, he nonetheless wrote a number of adult titles, including this 1922 novel in which guests at a country estate become amateur sleuths when a shooting occurs and all evidence points toward their host.

Michael Smith explores the world of Shamanism and Jungian psychology by bringing them together in a dialogue: Jung&#39;s concepts are examined shamanically and shamanic concepts are examined from a Jungian perspective. Shamanism is considered to be a complex of practices of a magico-religious character concerned primarily with psychospiritual and psychosomatic healing.Addressing the need for a systematic dialogue between the psychology of Jung and Shamanism, Smith first provides an overview of the basic elements of classic Shamanism, drawing from the history of religions and cultural and medical anthropology. Then he examines Jung&#39;s life and development in terms of shamanic themes and parallels, and how Jung arrived at these psychological ideas through active imagination and other techniques. Finally, the author reflects on the clinical and cultural implications of this study on psychotherapy and spirituality today.</p><p><p> C. Michael Smith, Ph.D., is a clinical psychologist, philosopher, and writer specializing in the interface of psychotherapeutic and spiritual resources, and is author of Psychotherapy and the Sacred, and the forthcoming A Little Psychology of the Heart. He attended the University of Chicago, the Chicago Theological Seminary, and the C. G. Jung Institute of Chicago. He currently lives and practices at the Crows Nest Retreat Center, in Southwest, Michigan, where he conducts wilderness retreats, workshops, and mentoring programs for psychotherapists. </p></p><h2>Cello Time Sprinters: A third book of pieces for cello</h2><p><p>Descripci�n Cello Time Sprinters is the third book in this hugely successful series, building on the firm technical and stylistic foundations of Joggers and Runners by featuring extended pieces in first position, and fourth position pieces.

Straightforward piano accompaniments are available in a separate volume. </p></p><p>Kathy Blackwell, B. Mus. (Hons.), LTCL, LGSM, studied music at Edinburgh University and continued with post-graduate studies in music at the University of Oxford. Kathy is a string teacher with many years experience of teaching violin and viola. She developed her teaching ideas at the coalface in both Music Services and in private practice, working with groups large and small and in one-to-one lessons. She was a strings consultant for the ABRSM Music Medals initiative, a new assessment specifically designed for students taught in groups, and a contributor to the accompanying book All together! Teaching Music in Groups (ABRSM, 2004). Her teaching experience has led her to co-author Fiddle, Viola, and Cello Time, published by Oxford University Press, with her husband, David. Kathy and David have presented workshops in the UK, Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. David Blackwell studied music at Edinburgh University, after which he pursued a career in music publishing, first at ABRSM and then at Oxford University Press. He is co-editor of OUP&#39;s In the Mood: 17 Jazz Classics for Choirs and Carols for Choirs 5, and has published a number of single choral arrangements. He is co-writer with his wife Kathy of OUP&#39;s award-winning string series, Fiddle, Viola, Cello Time, and String Time, which have twice won the MIA award for Best Educational Publication. He now works as a freelance music editor, composer and arranger. In 2017 Kathy and David Blackwell received two awards: from ESTA UK in recognition of their exceptional services to string teaching, and from the Oxfordshire Music Education Partnership for significant contribution to music education in Oxfordshire and beyond.What I like about this volume is that the music composed especially or selected and arranged will elicit a distinct emotional response from the player and from any audience they might play to . . .

He makes friends with elephants, narrowly avoids falling victim to the poison of madness and saves a maharajah from a killer tiger.</p><p><i>Cigars of the Pharaoh</i> is one of Tintin's earliest adventures. He and Snowy are on a cruise to Egypt when they happen to meet Professor Sophocles Sarcophagus (the first of Tintin's absent-minded professors) and join his expedition.

Most significantly, Tintin meets the detectives Thompson and Thomson as well as the movie mogul Rastapopolous. While <i>Cigars of the Pharaoh</i> is a self-contained story, some of the mysteries are resolved in <i>The Blue Lotus</i>. Herge wrote <i>Cigars</i> in 1932 then revised it in 1955, which is why the art has the more polished look of later stories as well as the anachronistic glimpse of a copy of <i>Destination: Moon</i>. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>The Adventures of TinTin - Comic book format</p><h2>MathXL Student Access Kit</h2><p>This Web-based diagnostic testing and tutorial system allows students to take practice tests correlated to the textbook and receive customized study plans based on their results.

Adrian Vickers takes the reader on a journey across the social and political landscape of modern Indonesia, starting with the country&#39;s origins under the Dutch in the early twentieth-century, and the subsequent anti-colonial revolution which led to independence in 1949. Thereafter the spotlight is on the 1950s, a crucial period in the formation of Indonesia as a new nation, followed by the Sukarno years, and the anti-Communist massacres of the 1960s when General Suharto took over as president. The concluding chapters chart the fall of Suharto&#39;s New Order after thirty two years in power, and the subsequent political and religious turmoil which culminated in the Bali bombings in 2002. Adrian Vickers is Professor of Asian Studies at the University of Wollongong. He has previously worked at the Universities of New South Wales and Sydney, and has been a visiting fellow at the University of Indonesia and Udayana University (Bali). Vickers has more than twenty-five years research experience in Indonesia and the Netherlands, and has travelled in Southeast Asia, the U.S. and Europe in the course of his research. He is author of the acclaimed Bali: a Paradise Created (Penguin, 1989) as well as many other scholarly and popular works on Indonesia. In 2003 Adrian Vickers curated the exhibition Crossing Boundaries, a major survey of modern Indonesian art, and has also been involved in documentary films, including Done Bali (Negara Film and Television Productions, 1993).</p><p>Adrian Vickers takes the reader on a journey across the social and political landscape of modern Indonesia, a relatively unfamiliar and understudied country.

Written in short, carefully numbered paragraphs of extreme compression and brilliance, it immediately convinced many of its readers and captivated the imagination of all. Its chief influence, at first, was on the Logical Positivists of the 1920s and 30s, but many other philosophers were stimulated by its philosophy of language, finding attractive, if ultimately unsatisfactory, its view that propositions were pictures of reality. Perhaps most of all, Wittgenstein himself, after his return to philosophy in the late 1920s, was fascinated by its vision of an inexpressible, crystalline world of logical relationships. The posthumous publication of other writings has, therefore, only served to reawaken interest in the <em>Tractatus</em> and to illuminate its more neglected aspects.<br>David Pears and Brian McGuinness revised their translation in the light of Wittgenstein's own suggestions and comments in his correspondence with C.K. Ogden about the first translation. In addition, this edition contains the introduction by Bertrand Russell which appeared in the original English translation.</p><p>Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) was arguably the most influential philosopher of the twentieth century. He was born in Vienna, but studied and practiced philosophy in Great Britain. He was a professor of philosophy at the University of Cambridge from 1939 until 1947. He worked in and transformed the fields of logic, the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language.<br>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Chicago by the Book: 101 Publications That Shaped the City and Its Image</h2><p>Despite its rough-and-tumble image, Chicago has long been identified as a city where books take center stage. In fact, a volume by A. J. Liebling&nbsp;gave the Second City its nickname. Upton Sinclair&#x2019;s <i>The Jungle</i> arose from the midwestern capital&#x2019;s most infamous industry. The great Chicago Fire led to the founding of the Chicago Public Library. The city has fostered writers such as Nelson Algren, Saul Bellow, and Gwendolyn Brooks. Chicago&#x2019;s literary magazines <i>The Little Review</i> and <i>Poetry </i>introduced the world to Eliot, Hemingway, Joyce, and Pound. The city&#x2019;s robust commercial printing industry supported a flourishing culture of the book. With this beautifully produced collection,&nbsp;Chicago&#x2019;s rich literary tradition finally gets its due.<br><br><i>Chicago by the Book</i> profiles 101 landmark publications about Chicago from the past 170 years that have helped define the city and its image. Each title&#x2014;carefully selected by the Caxton Club, a venerable Chicago bibliophilic organization&#x2014;is the focus of an illustrated essay by a leading scholar, writer, or bibliophile.<br><br> Arranged chronologically to show the history of both the city and its books, the essays can be read in order from Mrs. John H. Kinzie&#x2019;s 1844 <i>Narrative of the Massacre of Chicago</i> to Sara Paretsky&#x2019;s 2015 crime novel <i>Brush Back</i>. Or one can dip in and out, savoring reflections on the arts, sports, crime, race relations, urban planning, politics, and even Mrs. O&#x2019;Leary&#x2019;s legendary cow. The selections do not shy from the underside of the city, recognizing that its grit and graft have as much a place in the written imagination as soaring odes and boosterism. As Neil Harris observes in his introduction, &#x201c;Even when Chicagoans celebrate their hearth and home, they do so while acknowledging deep-seated flaws.&#x201d; At the same time, this collection heartily reminds us all of what makes Chicago, as Norman Mailer called it, the &#x201c;great American city.&#x201d;<br><br> With essays from, among others, Ira Berkow, Thomas Dyja, Ann Durkin Keating, Alex Kotlowitz, Toni Preckwinkle, Frank Rich, Don Share, Carl Smith, Regina Taylor, Garry Wills, and William Julius Wilson; and featuring works by Saul Bellow, Gwendolyn Brooks, Sandra Cisneros, Clarence Darrow, Erik Larson, David Mamet, Studs Terkel, Ida B.

Patton was a remarkable leader who trained and motivated his men to achieve astounding results. With an emphasis on mission, he transformed an utterly demoralized American force in North Africa into an army capable of defeating the Nazis' brilliant General Rommel. Storming across France into Germany at a breakneck pace, his unit conquered more enemy troops and liberated more civilians than any other in World War II. Now Alan Axelrod, an accomplished writer in the areas of both military history and business management, applies Patton's proven leadership principles and competitive tactics to the corporate battlefield.</p><p> Executives and managers will learn straightforward, practical lessons in dynamic, results-oriented management. Illuminated by Patton's own words, chapters cover how to develop a leadership attitude and image, communicate effectively, establish clear priorities, inspire others, instill loyalty, build a team, coach and mentor, resolve conflict, and sustain optimum performance. And, as a man who regularly was required to overcome his failings or turn them to his advantage, Patton offers an example of excellence within reach of all of us. </p><p> Featuring an insert of World War II photographs, PATTON ON LEADERSHIP will inspire today's workplace leaders as it urges them on toward victory in their own companies.</p></p><p>Quotes for <i>Patton on Leadership</i> <p>In the three years from 1942 to 1945, Patton won a war on the mantra of 'Speed, Simplicity and Boldness.' In the three years from 1995 to 1998, using that same mantra, Warner-Lambert went from a company described as 'amongst the walking dead of the pharmaceutical industry' to an enterprise ranked with the world's top 50 firms in market value.

The result of a unique, multi-year collaboration among stakeholder groups from across the political spectrum, the two volumes offer a dispassionate consideration of a highly polarized topic.</p><p>Renewing the Conservation Promise, Volume 1, puts the reader in a better position to make informed decisions about future directions in biodiversity conservation by elevating the policy debate from its current state of divisive polemics to a more-constructive analysis. It helps the reader understand how the Endangered Species Act has been implemented, the consequences of that implementation, and how the act could be changed to better serve the needs of both the species it is designed to protect and the people who must live within its mandates. Volume 2, which examines philosophical, biological, and economic dimensions of the act in greater detail, will be published in 2006.</p><p>As debate over reforming the Endangered Species Act heats up in the coming months, these two books will be essential references for policy analysts and lawmakers; professionals involved with environmental law, science, or management; and academic researchers and students concerned with environmental law, policy, management, or science.</p></p><p>Dale D.

Counselors' personalities, the history of their relationships with athletes, the interaction of individual psychologists and athletes with entire teams&#x2014;these factors are at least as important as the application of standard procedures. This book reveals in intimate detail the process of sport psychology at work.</p><p>The text, edited by psychologist Mark B. Andersen, includes<br>-details of sessions directed by professionals using a variety of models: cognitive-behavioral, rational-emotive, performance enhancement, developmental, and psychodynamic;</p><p>-transcripts of dialogue between counselors and athletes in many different sports, which clearly demonstrate what sport psychology sessions actually sound like; </p><p>-descriptive commentaries on why the psychologists chose the therapeutic path they did and what other options they might have chosen; and</p><p>-specifics on how a wide variety of people&#x2014;including coaches, physical therapists, and other professionals who work with athletes and performers&#x2014;administer sport psychology. <br><b>Part I,</b> ""Getting Started,"" details first encounters, intake sessions, and establishment of working relationships. Removing psychological barriers to optimal performance and managing athletes' inevitable stressors are covered here. In every instance, actual session transcripts reveal how counselors related to people in specific situations.</p><p><b>Part II,</b> ""From the Applied Sport Psychology Canon,"" covers traditional topics such as goal setting, relaxation, imagery, and self-talk. But these interventions are not as easy to deliver as some texts imply. The focus here is on how such techniques are applied in real-life situations. </p><p><b>Part III,</b> ""Beyond Performance Enhancement: Working With and Working Through,"" reveals what clinical/counseling sessions with athletes really sound like. Performance-enhancing sessions often expose deeper clinical issues such as personal loss, depression, or eating disorders.</p><p><b>Part IV,</b> ""The Study of Service: From Supervision to Complex Delivery,"" deals with advanced topics. Some of the world's most experienced sport psychologists provide their insight regarding supervising others who deliver psychological services, dealing with interns, and developing long-term relationships with elite athletes. </p><p><b>Part V,</b> ""Branching Out: Other Practitioners, Other Settings,"" provides details of sessions with injured athletes, cross country runners, athletes who are retiring from professional sports, and even a musician (illustrating how sport psychology is broadly applicable to any endeavor where performance is important).</p><p>This book provides powerful and revealing insights into how sport psychology is done by the people who do it best.</p><p>Mark B.

Sweeping away centuries of myth and confusion, John Romer describes for the first time exactly how the Great Pyramid was designed and built. He argues that the pyramid makers worked from a single plan whose existence has long been doubted and even denied by scholars. Moreover, the Great Pyramid&#39;s unique architecture is integral to the way it was built, and for its builders the tasks of construction and design were not separate as they are now. By placing this awesome monument in its genuine contemporary context, this book underlines the extraordinary talents and the originality of the ancient Egyptians at the time of King Khufu.</p><p>The Great Pyramid&#39;s eerily precise architecture has long puzzled mystics and archaeologists and given rise to numerous modern fantasies concerning the so-called &#39;Mystery of the Pyramids&#39;.

In the decades following his wife's 1963 suicide, Hughes kept silent, a stance many have seen as guilty, few as dignified. While an industry grew out of Plath's life and art, and even her afterlife, he continued to compose his own dark, unconfessional verses, and edited her <i>Collected Poems</i>, <i>Letters Home: Correspondence 1950-1963</i>, and <i>Journals</i>. But Hughes's conservancy (and his sister Olwyn's power as Plath's executrix) laid him open to yet more blame. Biographers and critics found his cuts to her letters self-interested, and decried his destruction of the journals of her final years--undertaken, he insisted, for the sake of their children. <p> In <i>Birthday Letters</i> we now have Hughes's response to Plath's white-hot mythologizing. Lost happiness intensifies present pain, but so does old despair: "Your ghost," he acknowledges, "inseparable from my shadow." Ranging from accessible short-story-like verses to tightly wound, allusive lyrics, the poems push forward from initial encounters to key moments long after Plath's death. In "Visit," he writes, "I look up--as if to meet your voice / With all its urgent future / that has burst in on me. Then look back / At the book of the printed words. / You are ten years dead. It is only a story. / Your story. My story." These poems are filled with conditionals and might-have-beens, Hughes never letting us forget forces in motion before their seven-year marriage and final separation. When he first sees Plath, she is both scarred (from her earlier suicide attempt) and radiant: "Your eyes / Squeezed in your face, a crush of diamonds, / Incredibly bright, bright as a crush of tears..." But Fate and Plath's father, Otto, will not let them be. In the very next poem, "The Shot," her trajectory is already plotted. Though Hughes is her victim, her real target is her dead father--"the god with the smoking gun." </p><p> Of course, "The Shot" and the accusatory "The Dogs Are Eating Your Mother" are an incitement to those who side (as if there is a side!) with Plath. <i>Newsweek</i> has already chalked up the reaction of poet and feminist Robin Morgan to the book: "My teeth began to grind uncontrollably." But Hughes makes it clear that his poems are written for his dead wife and living children, not her acolytes' bloodsport. He has also, of course, written them for himself and the reader. Pieces such as "Epiphany," "The 59th Bear," and "Life After Death" are masterful mixes of memory and image. In "Epiphany," for instance, the young Hughes, walking in London, suddenly spots a man carrying a fox inside his jacket. Offered the cub for a pound, he hesitates, knowing he and Plath couldn't handle the animal--not with a new baby, not in the city. But in an instant, his potent vision extends beyond the animal, perhaps to his and Plath's children: </p><blockquote> Already past the kittenish<br> But the eyes still small,<br> Round, orphaned-looking, woebegone<br> As if with weeping. Bereft<br> Of the blue milk, the toys of feather and fur,<br> The den life's happy dark. And the huge whisper<br> Of the constellations<br> Out of which Mother had always returned. </blockquote> Other poems are more influenced by Plath's "terrible, hypersensitive fingers," including "The Bee God" and "Dreamers," which is apparently a record of Plath's one encounter with Hughes's mistress: "She fascinated you. Her eyes caressed you, / Melted a weeping glitter at you. / Her German the dark undercurrent / In her Kensington jeweller's elocution / Was your ancestral Black Forest whisper--" This exotic woman, "slightly filthy with erotic mystery," seems a close relation to Plath's own Lady Lazarus, and the poem would be equally powerful without any biographical information. This is the one paradoxical pity of this superb collection. These poems require no prior knowledge--but for better or worse, we possess it.Ted Hughes was born on 17 August 1930 in Mytholmroyd, a small mill town in West Yorkshire. His father made portable wooden buildings. The family moved to Mexborough, a coal-mining town in South Yorkshire, when Hughes was seven. His parents took over a newsagent and tobacconist shop, and eventually he went to the local grammar school.In 1948 Hughes won an Open Exhibition to Pembroke College, Cambridge. Before going there, he served two years National Service in the Royal Air Force. Between leaving Cambridge and becoming a teacher, he worked at various jobs, finally as a script-reader for Rank at their Pinewood Studios.In 1956 Hughes married the American poet Sylvia Plath, who died in 1963, and they had two children. He remarried in 1970. He was awarded the OBE in 1977, created Poet Laureate in December 1984 and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1998. He died in October 1998.Ted Hughes&#39;s first book, The Hawk in the Rain, was published by Fabe</p><h2>T.S. Eliot and Prejudice</h2><p>This is an examination of T.S. Eliot&#39;s poetry in which the author considers the works against a background of the social and political problems of prejudice. Eliot was writing at a time of great contradiction in thought; never has the accusation of prejudice been stronger, and yet never has there been so wide an agreement that no understanding of anything is possible without preconceptions. Christopher Ricks is author of &#34;Milton&#39;s Grand Style&#34;, &#34;Tennyson&#34;, &#34;Keats and Embarrassment&#34; and &#34;The Force of Poetry&#34;.</p><p>Christopher Ricks is co-director of the Editorial Institute and Warren Professor of Humanities at Boston University. He is author of numerous works of literary criticism, including Beckett&#39;s Dying Words (1993) and is responsible for the forthcoming new edition of The Complete Poetry of T. S. Eliot (2011). He was knighted for his services to scholarship in 2009.Ricks has written not merely a fine study of T.S. Eliot but an interesting work of criticism that combines the best of New Criticism (a strict reading of texts and keen awareness of ambiguity) and of Deconstruction (a sensitivity to the way the text undercuts itself and deliberately frustrates simplistic "reader responses"). Ricks does an admirable job of explicating Eliot's "Prufrock," and in all his readings he gives fresh evidence of the highly complicated mind Eliot brought to bear on even the titles of his work. This is not another tired discussion of Eliot's racial prejudices (which Ricks nicely contrasts with those of Pound) but a profound inquiry into the nature of writing about prejudice, a kind of minefield where "even the demolition squad sows its own bombs."

On the color wheel, my father is a rich mocha, my sister is a warm copper, and my mother is a perfectly tanned caramel; I am somewhere between cream and eggshell on the opposite end of the spectrum. Being stereotypically white can be difficult when you&#x2019;re African American.</p> <p>The beginning of high school was when I first began to feel that my fair complexion hid my true identity. When I entered ninth grade, I was delighted to find myself in the company of an entirely new group of friends. Upon meeting my parents for the first time, my friends smiled warmly at my mother and gaped at my father, their eyes widening as they flitted between him and myself. However, I was pleased to find that all of them were accepting of my family&#x2019;s ethnic composition. As our group became closer, we often discussed our futures. During one conversation, we outlined our weddings, collapsing into fits of giggles upon hearing each other&#x2019;s extravagant dreams. Once our laughter had subsided, one girl said more seriously, &#x201c;One thing&#x2019;s for sure, I could never marry a black guy. It would just be too difficult with the race thing.&#x201d; I blinked, waiting for a reaction. None came. Why had no one jumped to my defense? Did people not see my white mother and my black father when they looked at me? It was then that I realized to my friends, I wasn&#x2019;t black.</p> <p>Incidents like this made me recognize that being biracial has inherently given me perspective that many people lack. When a friend told me that her parents would never allow her to date someone of a different race, I couldn&#x2019;t understand why. When I revealed my biracial heritage to a black friend, she became noticeably warmer toward me and happily shared the news with her friends as we walked by them in the hall. My much darker sister does not share these experiences. We draw from the exact same gene pool, but my sister&#x2019;s complexion allows her complete racial inheritance to shine while mine cloaks half of it.</p> <p>My sister knows her race because her appearance reflects it. But do I? Is a girl still black if nobody sees it? Should it matter? Growing up pale, blond, and black has influenced me. I feel obligated to immediately tell people about my race because my looks do not convey it. Nevertheless, I know who I am. Though my friends joke about me skipping the &#x201c;black gene,&#x201d; I am just as connected to my father&#x2019;s Louisiana roots as I am to my mother&#x2019;s Alabaman ancestors. Racial identity is marked by more than arbitrary features like skin tone, and while we are unable to choose our exact coloring, we do choose who we are. My appearance and the responses it elicits have shaped me but do not control me. Beneath fair hair and light skin, I see a girl who is both black and white. I see me.</p> <p>REVIEW</p> <p>At first glance, Caden&#x2019;s essay seems like a generic essay about &#x201c;diversity&#x201d;&#x2014;a hot college-acceptance buzzword. Wrong. Caden takes the important topic of identity and weaves it into a beautifully composed coming-of-age tale, showing how her self-confidence and ability to overcome challenges grew. She writes in a playful tone that makes reading her essay an entertaining experience rather than a chore. By incorporating memories of conversations with friends in her freshman year in high school, she lets readers into her personal life, taking the edge off the serious undertones of her conflicts with &#x201c;extravagant dreams [of weddings].&#x201d; This combination of her racial identity issues and her youthful memories shows a maturity of thought and understanding of others as well as herself.</p> <p>However, she does not forget to draw the attention back to the key point of her story&#x2014;her firm acceptance of her character. After her first two sprightly paragraphs, her tone shifts and becomes authoritative. She employs short and straightforward sentences as the essay progresses, such as the declaration: &#x201c;I know who I am&#x201d; in the final paragraph. Caden writes with a powerful voice that distinctly proves she accepts her biracial identity, despite her appearance that leads others to make false assumptions. Although the final line, &#x201c;I see me,&#x201d; can be seen as a reach, it works for Caden. By that point in the essay, she has earned it. It caps off the confident tone of the last few paragraphs that express her comfort with her racial identity. All in all, Caden created a well-written story that displays both her writing prowess through smooth transitions between different voices and her ability to overcome the greatest challenge of being comfortable in one&#x2019;s skin.</p> <p>&#x2014;Jiho Kang</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by <i>The Harvard Crimson</i></p></p><h2>Aristotle: On the Soul. Parva Naturalia. On Breath. (Loeb Classical Library No. 288)</h2><p><p>Aristotle, great Greek philosopher, researcher, reasoner, and writer, born at Stagirus in 384 BCE, was the son of Nicomachus, a physician, and Phaestis. He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367&#x2013;47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias&#x2019;s relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343&#x2013;2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip&#x2019;s death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of &#x201c;Peripatetics&#x201d;), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander&#x2019;s death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322.Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>; <i>Great Ethics</i> (<i>Magna Moralia</i>); <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>; <i>Politics</i>; <i>Oeconomica</i> (on the good of the family); <i>Virtues and Vices</i>.<br>II. Logical: <i>Categories</i>; <i>On Interpretation</i>; <i>Analytics</i> (<i>Prior</i> and <i>Posterior</i>); <i>On Sophistical Refutations</i>; <i>Topica</i>.<br>III. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc.<br>IV. <i>Metaphysics</i>: on being as being.<br>V. On Art: <i>Art of Rhetoric</i> and <i>Poetics</i>.<br>VI. Other works including the <i>Athenian Constitution</i>; more works also of doubtful authorship.<br>VII. Fragments of various works such as dialogues on philosophy and literature; and of treatises on rhetoric, politics and metaphysics.The Loeb Classical Library� edition of Aristotle is in twenty-three volumes.</p></p><p><p>Walter Stanley Hett (1882&#x2013;1948) was Assistant Master of Brighton College (UK).</p></p><h2>The Picture of Dorian Gray (Macmillan Collector&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p>Designed to appeal to the book lover, the Macmillan Collector's Library is a series of beautifully bound pocket-sized gift editions of much loved classic titles. Bound in real cloth, printed on high quality paper, and featuring ribbon markers and gilt edges, Macmillan Collector's Library are books to love and treasure. </p><p>On its first publication <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> was regarded as dangerously modern in its depiction of fin-de-si�cle decadence. In this updated version of the Faust story, the tempter is Lord Henry Wotton, who lives selfishly for amoral pleasure; Dorian's good angel is the portrait painter Basil Hallward, whom Dorian murders. The book highlights the tension between the polished surface of high society and the life of secret vice. Although sin is punished in the end the book has a flavour of the elegantly perverse.</p><p>With an Afterword by Peter Harness.</p></p><p>A lush, cautionary tale of a life of vileness and deception or a loving portrait of the aesthetic impulse run rampant? Why not both? After Basil Hallward paints a beautiful, young man's portrait, his subject's frivolous wish that the picture change and he remain the same comes true. Dorian Gray's picture grows aged and corrupt while he continues to appear fresh and innocent. After he kills a young woman, "as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife," Dorian Gray is surprised to find no difference in his vision or surroundings. "The roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden." <p> As Hallward tries to make sense of his creation, his epigram-happy friend Lord Henry Wotton encourages Dorian in his sensual quest with any number of Wildean paradoxes, including the delightful "When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy." But despite its many languorous pleasures, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is an imperfect work. Compared to the two (voyeuristic) older men, Dorian is a bore, and his search for ever new sensations far less fun than the novel's drawing-room discussions. Even more oddly, the moral message of the novel contradicts many of Wilde's supposed aims, not least "no artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style." Nonetheless, the glamour boy gets his just deserts. And Wilde, defending Dorian Gray, had it both ways: "All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own punishment."</p>Oscar Wilde's only published full length novel, is the story of a man who sells his soul for eternal youth. In exchange, what does he give up and what does he gain? This novel, by Wilde is a wonderful soul-searching example of the cost of paradise, and the price of a wish. <p>Read by actor, comedian, novelist, journalist, screenwriter Stephen Fry, Dorian Gray's dilemma comes alive. He has also acted in a variety of films including A Fish Called Wanda, Peter's Friends, and The Wind in the Willows.</p></p><h2>Robinson Crusoe: His Life and Strange Surprising Adventures (Everyman&#39;s Library Children&#39;s Classics Series)</h2><p>This classic story of a shipwrecked mariner on a deserted island is perhaps the greatest adventure in all of English literature. Fleeing from pirates, Robinson Crusoe is swept ashore in a storm possessing only a knife, a box of tobacco, a pipe-and the will to survive. His is the saga of a man alone: a man who overcomes self-pity and despair to reconstruct his life; who painstakingly teaches himself how to fashion a pot, bake bread, build a canoe; and who, after twenty-four agonizing years of solitude, discovers a human footprint in the sand... Consistently popular since its first publication in 1719, Daniel Defoe's story of human endurance in an exotic, faraway land exerts a timeless appeal. The first important English novel, <b>Robinson Crusoe</b> has taken its rightful place among the great myths of Western civilization.</p><p><p>Thought to have been inspired by the true-life experiences of a marooned sailor, <i>Robinson Crusoe </i>tells the story of the sole survivor of a shipwreck, stranded on a Caribbean island, who prevails against all odds, enduring almost three decades of solitude while mastering both himself and his strange new world. First published in 1719, the novel has long been one of the English language's great adventure stories.<br>In the journal he shares with us, the endearing, goatskin-clad castaway recounts the details of this lonely existence and his many adventures, including a fierce battle with cannibals and a daring rescue of Friday, the man who becomes his trusted servant and companion. Defoe's brilliant and imaginative use of detail renders Crusoe's island world utterly convincing. In reclaiming his humanity from the savagery of his circumstances, the hero humbly acquires the qualities of courage, patience, ingenuity, and industry.<br>Hailed as the first great English novel, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> spawned legions of imitations, none of which surpass the original. All readers with a taste for adventure will relish this inexpensive edition of one of the most popular and influential books ever written.</p>Daniel Defoe was born Daniel Foe in London in 1660. It was perhaps, ineveitable that Defoe, an outspoken man, would become a political journalist. As a Puritan he believed God had given him a mission to print the truth, that is, to proselytize on religion and politics, and in fact, he became a prolific pamphleteer satirizing the hypocrisies of both Church and State. Defoe admired William III, and his poem&nbsp;<i>The True-Born Englishman&nbsp;</i>(1701) won him the King's friendship. But an ill-timed satire on High Church extremists, The Shortest Way with the Dissenters, published during Queen Anne's reign, resulted in his being pilloried and imprisoned for seditious libel in 1703.&nbsp;<br><br>At fifty-nine Defoe turned to fiction, completing&nbsp;<i>The Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(1719), partly based on the saga of Alexander Selkirk, a Scottish sailor;&nbsp;<i>Moll Flanders&nbsp;</i>(1722);&nbsp;<i>Colonel Jack</i>&nbsp;(1722);&nbsp;<i>A Journal of the Plague Years<b>&nbsp;</b></i>(1722); and&nbsp;<i>Roxana or the Fortunate Mistress</i>&nbsp;(1724).</p><h2>Color for the Sciences (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>A comprehensive introduction to colorimetry from a conceptual perspective.</b></p><p><i>Color for the Sciences</i> is the first book on colorimetry to offer an account that emphasizes conceptual and formal issues rather than applications. Jan Koenderink's introductory text treats colorimetry&#x2015;literally, &#x201c;color measurement&#x201d;&#x2015;as a science, freeing the topic from the usual fixation on conventional praxis and how to get the &#x201c;right&#x201d; result. Readers of Color for the Sciences will learn to rethink concepts from the roots in order to reach a broader, conceptual understanding.</p><p>After a brief account of the history of the discipline (beginning with Isaac Newton) and a chapter titled &#x201c;Colorimetry for Dummies,&#x201d; the heart of the book covers the main topics in colorimetry, including the space of beams, achromatic beams, edge colors, optimum colors, color atlases, and spectra. Other chapters cover more specialized topics, including implementations, metrics pioneered by Schr�dinger and Helmholtz, and extended color space.</p><p><i>Color for the Sciences</i> can be used as a reference for professionals or in a formal introductory course on colorimetry. It will be especially useful both for those working with color in a scientific or engineering context who find the standard texts lacking and for professionals and students in image engineering, computer graphics, and computer science. Each chapter ends with exercises, many of which are open-ended, suggesting ways to explore the topic further, and can be developed into research projects. The text and notes contain numerous suggestions for demonstration experiments and individual explorations. The book is self-contained, with formal methods explained in appendixes when necessary. </p></p><p>Jan Koenderink was Professor of Physics at Utrecht University for many years. He is currently a Research Fellow at Delft University of Technology and Visiting Professor at MIT and �cole National Sup�rieure Paris. He is the author of <i>Solid Shape</i> (MIT Press, 1990).<p><i>Color for the Sciences</i> is an imaginative and thorough exploration of color science: suitable as an introduction for students, yet packed with insights and technical details that will engage the expert as well. The history, mathematics, experimental techniques, practical applications, and even philosophical implications of color science are woven together in an informal style that makes the book a pleasure to read and an invaluable resource not just to academics, but also to those in the corporate world who need to know color science for marketing and product design.</p>&#x2015;<b>Donald Hoffman</b>, University of California, Irvine</p><h2>Life Without Limits: 10 Easy Steps to Success &amp; Happiness</h2><p>Are there any desperate areas in life?

Learn jazz harmony, as taught at Berklee College of Music. This text provides a strong foundation in harmonic principles, supporting further study in jazz composition, arranging, and improvisation. It covers basic chord types and their tensions, with practical demonstrations of how they are used in characteristic jazz contexts and an accompanying recording that lets you hear how they can be applied. The price of this book includes access to audio tracks online, for download or streaming, using the unique code inside the book. The audio features PLAYBACK+, a multi-functional audio player that allows you to slow down audio without changing pitch, set loop points, change keys, and pan left or right available exclusively from Hal Leonard.</p><p>When future beings unearth the artifacts of our culture, The Berklee Book of Jazz Harmony will stand out as the most complete summary of modern diatonic harmony used in jazz and popular music of this era. This book is detailed, sophisticated, and surprisingly hip. I especially enjoyed the chapter on the blues as well as how the authors noted the effect of beat placement on harmonic choices. This sentence struck me: 'We can hear and feel a chord operating one way when it arrives, but our interpretation of that chord can also adjust retroactively.' The book is replete with similar descriptions giving this complicated subject a life of its own, beyond the usual mathematics and terminology. --Dave Liebman<br><br>The Berklee Book of Jazz Harmony is eminently readable and user-friendly.

Tracing the exchange of ideas between history's key philosophers, <em>Philosophical Conversations: A Concise Historical Introduction</em> demonstrates that while constructing an argument or making a claim, one philosopher almost always has others in mind. The book addresses the fundamental questions of human life: Who are we? What can we know? How should we live? and What sort of reality do we inhabit? Throughout, author Norman Melchert provides a generous selection of excerpts from major philosophical works and makes them more easily understandable with his lucid explanations. Extensive cross-references highlight the organizing themes and show students how philosophers have responded to each other's arguments.<br><br>A more concise edition of Norman Melchert's <em>The Great Conversation: A Historical Introduction to Philosophy,</em> Fifth Edition, <em>Philosophical Conversations</em> is designed to be especially accessible and visually attractive to first- and second-year college students in introduction to philosophy courses.

Psychologist Rachel Harris here shares her own healing experiences and draws on her original research (the largest study of ayahuasca use in North America) into the powerful medicine&#x2019;s effects on depression, addiction, PTSD, and anxiety. In this wide-ranging and personal exploration, Harris details ayahuasca&#x2019;s risks and benefits, helping readers clarify their intentions and giving psychotherapists a template for transformative care and healing.</p></p><p>Psychologist <b>Rachel Harris</b>, PhD, has been in private practice for thirty-five years. She has received a National Institutes of Health New Investigator&#x2019;s Award, published more than forty scientific studies in peer-reviewed journals, and worked as a psychological consultant to Fortune 500 companies. She lives on an island off the coast of Maine and in the San Francisco Bay Area.&#x201c;An excellent book on the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca; clearly written and well researched, it is an important addition to the literature on the subject.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Jeremy Narby, PhD, author of <em>The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge</em></strong><br> <br> &#x201c;Finally, finally, finally &#x2014; an ayahuasca book I can recommend without reservation. Rachel Harris focuses not on the journey (giant snakes, dismemberment, insights, purging, etc.) but on what eventually matters far more: the ongoing and robust aftereffects in people &#x2019;s lives. Harris is a skilled psychotherapist and a serious ayahuasca user, and her credibility in both worlds makes her own story, interwoven with those of the many people she interviewed, informative and discerning.&#x201d; <br> <strong>&#x2014; James Fadiman, PhD, microdose researcher and author of <em>The Psychedelic Explorer&#x2019;s Guide: Safe, Therapeutic, and Sacred Journeys</em></strong><br> <br> &#x201c;A fascinating and provocative compilation of riveting testimonies of individuals who experienced miraculous healing by drinking the psychedelic medicine ayahuasca. Inspired by her own amazing transformation, Harris was driven to research ayahuasca and document her findings. Readers will be inspired by the numerous accounts of how ayahuasca succeeded where Western medicine has failed many of the ailing people described here. . . . Though research on ayahuasca is still slim, the numerous life-changing revelations that Harris&#x2019;s contributors describe will be illuminating for those curious about this mystical medicine.&#x201d;<br> <strong><em>&#x2014; Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br> <br> &#x201c;Anyone considering visiting Grandmother Ayahuasca for the first time needs to read this book before making a decision. Harris is not an advocate, and her book is not a polemic; however, it seems clear that this plant medicine has the power to transform some people&#x2019;s lives in ways that seem to be filled with the magic and mystery so sadly missing from our overly civilized world.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Stanley Krippner, PhD, Alan Watts Professor of Psychology at Saybrook University, coauthor of <em>Personal Mythology</em>, and coeditor of <em>Varieties of Anomalous Experience</em></strong><br> <br> &#x201c;Rachel Harris has produced a uniquely brave study of ayahuasca use and users, through the experiences of others and, most significantly, her own explorations. She never dodges the big questions (Who or what is the guiding intelligence experienced?) or comes up with static answers. Instead, she moves through the mysterious process of self-encounter, sharing a string of hard-won insights into how ayahuasca can work its magic to relieve human suffering.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Diana Slattery, PhD, founding board member of Women&#x2019;s Visionary Congress and author of <em>Xenolinguistics:</em> <em>Psychedelics, Language, and the Evolution of Consciousness</em></strong><br> <br> &#x201c;Author and psychotherapist Rachel Harris&#x2019; recent book&nbsp;<em>. . .&nbsp;</em>offers something immeasurably&nbsp;valuable in the field of psychedelic discourse: a sane, responsible, well-informed voice&nbsp;in a chorus replete with fevered egos and third-hand hearsay.&nbsp;. . . Harris writes about her journey with honesty and clarity, offering many&nbsp;observations germane to the experience of therapy for people who are processing&nbsp;similar experiences.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; David Bey,&nbsp;Erowid.org</strong><br> <br> &#x201c;In Harris we have a guide we can trust: someone who for years has actively immersed herself in a wide variety of ritual ayahuasca contexts; who has thought long and hard about the shadow side of taking ayahuasca; and who does not let the all-too-human aspects of the ayahuasca experience undermine her willingness to underscore the potentially life-changing therapeutic potential of this powerful substance. With humor, care, and (it must be said) wisdom, Harris invites us to join her as she walks, eyes wide open, into the enchanted and wondrously thought-provoking world of Grandmother Ayahuasca.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; G. William Barnard, professor of religious studies at Southern Methodist University and author of <em>Exploring Unseen Worlds: William James and the Philosophy of Mysticism</em></strong><br> <br> &#x201c;If you are interested in any aspect of psychedelics, I emphatically recommend <em>Listening to Ayahuasca</em>. Writing with a long history both as a participant in healing ceremonies and as a very skilled therapist, Harris shows a deep awareness of this long-revered plant medicine &#x2019;s potential in helping patients not only heal difficult psychological problems but also, with proper guidance, integrate the experience into fuller emotional and spiritual dimensions.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; George Douvris, author of <em>Crossing Karma Zones</em></strong><br> <br> &#x201c;Rachel Harris delivers a refreshingly honest, balanced account of the complex literature concerning ayahuasca, discussing potential risks alongside purported benefits and allowing room for the sometimes extraordinary and mysterious experiences reported by initiates. At once accessible and well informed, this work represents a much-needed guidepost for health professionals who may encounter ayahuasca users in their practice, as well as for spiritual seekers with an interest in entheogens.&#x201d;<br> <strong>&#x2014; Albert Garcia-Romeu, PhD, Behavioral Pharmacology Research Unit, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</strong><br> <br> &#x201c;Rachel Harris brings . . . the perspective of an astute observer, the rigor of a scientist, the compassion of a therapist, and the insight that only a participant can offer.

This book provides an introduction to many of the worldview issues and philosophical foundations that frame the relationship of psychology and theology, includes scholarly reflection on the integration literature, and surveys five paradigms of possible relationships between psychology and Christianity. The book is designed to help readers become aware of the presuppositional backdrops that each of us brings to these issues, and to understand various approaches for relating psychology and Christianity as partly based on presuppositional assumptions. Questions at the end of each chapter are included to help readers evaluate both the material and their own burgeoning approach to integration. This book is ideal as a textbook for students of psychology and other behavioral and social sciences (social work, sociology, theology, counseling, pastoral counseling) at both the graduate and undergraduate level. It is also written for the broader readership of psychologists, counselors, pastors, and others who are interested in integration. Endorsements: &#34;&#34;Integrative Approaches to Psychology and Christianity belongs on the bookshelves of students, clinicians, and researchers alike. In this book Entwistle provides readers with a conceptual roadmap for exploring, examining, and understanding Christian integrative approaches--while serving as a knowledgeable mentor along the way--offering in-depth analyses, theoretical insights, and practical applications.&#34;&#34; --Jamie D. Aten, PhD Dr. Arthur P. Rech and Mrs. Jean May Rech Associate Professor of Psychology, Wheaton College and co-editor of Spirituality and the Therapeutic Process &#34;&#34;This book is a great resource for teaching the integration of psychology and Christianity. It is difficult to find a resource that articulates the main philosophical and theological ideas underlying good integration in one book.

Hankle, PhD Assistant Professor of Psychology Regent University &#34;&#34;Entwistle&#39;s book should be required reading for all students studying the integration of psychology and theology!

In the new edition, Entwistle takes another important step in formulating the integration of psychology and Christianity by addressing personal views of integration through the eyes of top psychological researchers in this field!

It was one of the few books that dared to look at how radical feminism could and should shape the future; and one whose predictions (the cybernetic revolution, for example) proved startlingly prescient of issues today. Published by Semiotext(e) in 1998, <i>Airless Spaces</i>, Firestone's first work of fiction, is a collection of short stories written by Firestone as she found herself drifting from the professional career path she'd been on and into what she describes as a new "airless space." These deadpan stories, set among the disappeared and darkened sectors of New York City, are about losers who fall prey to an increasingly bureaucratized poverty and find themselves in an out of (mental) hospitals. But what gives characters such as<i> SCUM-Manifesto</i> author Valerie Solanas their depth and charge, is their the small crises that trigger an awareness that they're in trouble. Some time later, after I had moved to St. Mark's Place, I saw Valerie in the street. She asked me for a quarter, and I saw that she was begging. She had lost her apartment, and presumably her welfare. Later, a friend of mine who ran a store on St. Mark's Place said that Valerie had approached him for shelter. She was covered with sores, and wearing only a blanket to beg in. She had been out on the street approximately three months without shelter. Not long after that, she disappeared from the street entirely.</p></p><p>Chris Kraus is the author of four novels, including <i>I Love Dick </i>and <i>Summer of Hate</i>; two books of art and cultural criticism; and most recently, <i>After Kathy Acker: A Literary Biography</i>.

He was also suffering after a series of troubling personal events. He was drinking heavily, quarrelling frequently, and experiencing powerful, disturbing dreams. Pauli turned to C. G. Jung for help, forging an extraordinary intellectual conjunction not just between a physicist and a psychologist but between physics and psychology. As their acquaintance developed, Jung and Pauli discussed the nature of dreams and their relation to reality, finding surprising common ground between depth psychology and quantum physics and profoundly influencing each other's work.</p><p>This portrait of an incredible friendship will fascinate readers interested in psychology, science, creativity, and genius.</p></p><p><p>"This unlikely correspondence between two outstanding exponents of apparently incompatible disciplines traces the development of an alchemical relationship through which each transforms the other's view of the universe. From the dreams of the nuclear scientist and the quantum speculations of the depth psychologist there grows a new understanding of mind and matter as joint manifestations of a deeper archetypal reality, known to medieval philosophy as the unus mundus. In the course of this rich dialogue, Jung formulates his insights into the significance of acausal happenings and meaningful coincidences, while both men forge the outlines of a unified framework able to embrace the seemingly infinite complexities of quantum physics and human psychology. Publication of these written exchanges between two of the most inventive minds of the twentieth century is an act of historic importance, as welcome as it is overdue."<b>--Anthony Stevens, author of <i>On Jung and Ariadne's Clue</i></b></p><p>"Psychologist Jung and physicist Pauli together explore the extraordinary world of quantum mechanics and particle physics, in which the influence of the observer upon the observed cannot be eliminated and where mind and matter merge.

To the creation of the other two, Merton Densher and the magnificent, predatory Kate Croy, who conspire in an act of deceit and betrayal, he brought a lifetime's distilled wisdom about the frailty of the human soul when it is trapped in the depths of need and desire. And he brought to the drama that unites these three characters, in the drawing rooms of London and on the storm-lit piazzas of Venice, a starkness and classical purity almost unprecedented in his work.<br><br>Under its brilliant, coruscating surfaces, beyond the scrim of its marvelous rhetorical and psychological devices, <i>The Wings of the Dove </i>offers an unfettered vision of our civilization and its discontents. It represents a culmination of James's art and, as such, of the art of the novel itself.<br><br></p></p><p><i>The Wings of the Dove</i> is a classic example of Henry James's morality tales that play off the naivet� of an American protagonist abroad. In early-20th-century London, Kate Croy and Merton Densher are engaged in a passionate, clandestine love affair. Croy is desperately in love with Densher, who has all the qualities of a potentially excellent husband: he's handsome, witty, and idealistic--the one thing he lacks is money, which ultimately renders him unsuitable as a mate. By chance, Croy befriends a young American heiress, Milly Theale. When Croy discovers that Theale suffers from a mysterious and fatal malady, she hatches a plan that can give all three characters something that they want--at a price. Croy and Densher plan to accompany the young woman to Venice where Densher, according to Croy's design, will seduce the ailing heiress. The two hope that Theale will find love and happiness in her last days and--when she dies--will leave her fortune to Densher, so that he and Croy can live happily ever after. The scheme that at first develops as planned begins to founder when Theale discovers the pair's true motives shortly before her death. Densher struggles with unanticipated feelings of love for his new paramour, and his guilt may obstruct his ability to avail himself of Theale's gift. James deftly navigates the complexities and irony of such moral treachery in this stirring novel.Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Levine&#39;s book is a brilliantly argued positive vision of American education and culture.</p><p>In 1987 <i>The Closing of the American Mind</i>, Allan Bloom's famously ferocious critique of the corrosive effects of political correctness in American universities, exploded like a bomb in the halls of the academy; even today, its conservative analysis is constantly enlarged upon by academics and political pundits alike, from Dinesh D'Souza to William J. Bennett. In <i>The Opening of the American Mind</i>, Lawrence W. Levine has produced a direct rebuttal. The conservative complainers are, he says, discomfited by perfectly healthy developments in education. Levine argues that opening the academic canon to cultures beyond Western civilization is a natural and laudable outgrowth of the increasing diversity of America. The universities are changing, says Levine, to keep in touch with the real world, and are "doing a more thorough and cosmopolitan job ... than ever before."Lawrence W. Levine is professor of history at George Mason University and Margaret Byrne Professor of History emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

The unassuming abbot of the Augustinian monastery in Brno (in today's Czech Republic) was rediscovered at the turn of the century when scientists were stunned to learn that their findings about inheritance had already been made by an unknown monk three decades earlier. A dedicated researcher who spent every spare hour in the study of the natural sciences, Mendel devised a series of brilliantly simple experiments using a plant easily grown on the monastery's grounds--the garden pea. In the course of just a few years he made the famous discoveries that later became the centerpiece of the science of heredity. In an entertaining and thoroughly informed narrative, Edward Edelson traces Mendel's life from his humble origins to his posthumous fame, giving us both a brief introduction to the fascinating science of genetics and an inspired account of what a modest man can accomplish with dedication and ingenuity.<br><br><em>Oxford Portraits in Science</em> is an ongoing series of scientific biographies for young adults. Written by top scholars and writers, each biography examines the personality of its subject as well as the thought process leading to his or her discoveries. These illustrated biographies combine accessible technical information with compelling personal stories to portray the scientists whose work has shaped our understanding of the natural world.<br></p><p>Edward Edelson is at New York University.Grade 7-10-Before Mendel's experiments with plants, there was only folk wisdom and the general acceptance that offspring-plant, animal, and human-resemble their parents. Even at the time of his death in 1884, Mendel's work was not widely known in the scientific community. This biography provides details of the scientist's life and his experiments as well as the political and social context of his times. Sidebars in some of the chapters are listed in the table of contents, making it easy to locate the discussion of such related topics as "Heredity before Mendel," "Mendel and Darwin," "Did Mendel Cheat?" and "The Human Genome Project." A two-page chronology tracks important events in his life and the vital contributions he made to the study of genetics. Black-and-white photographs, reproductions of artwork, and pages from the scientist's notebooks and manuscripts accompany the text.<br><i>Frances E.

Now, in this revised edition, Jay M. Feinman offers an updated survey of American law, spiced with new anecdotes and cases, and incorporating fresh material on topics ranging from the President's war powers, to intellectual property, standard form contracts, and eminent domain. <br> Here is an exceptionally clear introduction to law, covering the main subjects found in the first year of law school, giving us a basic understanding of how it all works. Readers are introduced to every aspect of the legal system, from constitutional law and the litigation process to tort law, contract law, property law, and criminal law. Feinman illuminates each discussion with many intriguing, outrageous, and infamous cases, from the scalding coffee case that cost McDonald's half a million dollars, to the sensational murder trial in Victorian London that led to the legal definition of insanity, to the epochal decision in <em>Marbury v. Madison</em> that gave the Supreme Court the power to declare state and federal laws unconstitutional. He broadens the reader's legal vocabulary, clarifying the meaning of everything from "due process" and "equal protection" in constitutional law, to the distinction between "murder" and "manslaughter" in criminal law. Perhaps most important, we learn that though the law is voluminous and complex, it is accessible to all. <br> Everyone who wants a better grasp of current legal issues--from students contemplating law school, to journalists covering the legislature or the courts, to fans of Court TV--will find here a wonderful source of information: a complete, clear, and colorful map of the American legal system. <br> <br> "An entertaining and informative introduction to the law....

He had neatly laid them out in graduated rows and spent the day acting as obliging salesman. He called the evanescent and unannounced street action&nbsp;<i>Bliz-aard Ball Sale</i>, thus inscribing it into a body of work that, from the late 1960s to the present, has used a lexicon of ephemeral actions and self-consciously &#x201c;black" materials to comment on the nature of the artwork, the art world, and race in America.&nbsp;And although&nbsp;<i>Bliz-aard Ball Sale</i>&nbsp;has been frequently cited and is increasingly influential, it has long been known only through a mix of eyewitness rumors and a handful of photographs.

Flann O&#39;Brien&#39;s first novel tells the story of a young, indolent undergraduate, who lives with his curmudgeonly uncle in Dubin and spends far too much time drinking with his friends. When not drunk or in bed he likes to invent wild stories peoples with hilarious and unlikely characters - but somehow his creations won&#39;t do what he wants them to. A dazzling work of farce, satire, folklore and absurdity that gives full rein to its author&#39;s dancing intellect and Celtic wit, At Swim-Two-Birds is both a brilliant comic send-up of Irish literature and culture, and a portrayal of Dublin to compare with Joyce&#39;s Ulysses. Brian � Nuall�in, (1911-1966), better known by his pseudonym Flann O&#39;Brien, was born in Strabane, County Tyrone, and studied at University College Dublin before joining the Irish Civil Service.

Ask me how I know. On the first level, it seems to emanate from the addled mind of a navel-gazing Irish university student stumbling around thinking about writing a book or a school paper. As I said, you can go nuts trying to follow it. Yet <i>At Swim-Two-Birds</i> is a modernist masterpiece, the best-known fictional work of Irish newspaper writer Flann O'Brien. Published in 1939, the book's great charm is O'Brien's constant reinvention of the English language, fueled and altered by an Irish sensibility and language; the sentences come out in a torrent of musical, drunken ramblings.Brian O'Nolan (Irish: Brian � Nuall�in) (5 October 1911 &#x2013; 1 April 1966) was an Irish novelist, playwright and satirist regarded as a key figure in postmodern literature.

We pick up bits of information from television and newspaper accounts of current legal battles, and from bestselling novels and popular movies. But these pieces do not give us an accurate or complete picture.<br> In <em>Law 101</em>, Jay M. Feinman offers a delightfully clear introduction to law, covering the main subjects found in the first year of law school and giving us a basic understanding of the American legal tradition. Readers are introduced to every aspect of the legal system, from constitutional law and the litigation process to tort law, contract law, property law, and criminal law. Feinman illuminates each discussion with many intriguing, outrageous, and infamous cases, from the scalding coffee case that cost McDonald's half a million dollars, to the sensational murder trial in Victorian London that led to the legal definition of insanity, to the epochal decision in Marbury v. Madison that gave the Supreme Court the power to declare state and federal laws unconstitutional. He broadens the reader's legal vocabulary, clarifying the meaning of everything from "due process" and "equal protection" in constitutional law, to the distinction between "murder" and "manslaughter" in criminal law. Perhaps most important, we learn that law is voluminous and complex, but accessible to everyone. <br> Anyone who enjoys Court TV will find this book irresistible. Everyone who wants a better grasp of current legal issues, from students contemplating law school to journalists covering the legislature or the courts, will find here a wonderful source of information--a complete, clear, and colorful map of the American legal system.</p><p>Thanks to TV cop shows, most Americans can probably recite the Miranda warnings, but do they know when the warnings do--and do not--apply? Tort reformers cite the $2.7 million in punitive damages a jury awarded a little old lady in Albuquerque when the cup of coffee she had set between her legs spilled and scalded her. These crusaders against "excessive" damage awards do not usually note that the trial judge reduced the award to $480,000, or that the coffee was 20 degrees hotter than competitors' coffee.<p> The law is all around. People continually invoke their rights, and every year millions of Americans are involved in formal legal proceedings. Yet most people are ignorant of even the basic concepts and organizing principles of U.S. law. Into the breach comes Jay Feinman's engrossing book <i>Law 101: Everything You Need to Know About the American Legal System</i>. Akin to a crash course in the first year of law school, <i>Law 101</i> is a clearly written, eminently readable guide to the tenets of our legal system. It is structured around basic questions such as "If a contract is unfair, can a court refuse to enforce it?" and replete with clarifying examples--real and hypothetical. In explaining battery, Feinman writes: "If someone consents to a certain bodily invasion, he does not necessarily consent to any bodily invasion, however. When Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield are in a boxing match, Holyfield has consented to Tyson punching him in the nose ... but he has not consented to Tyson biting off a piece of his ear." Much clearer.</p><p> <i>Law 101</i> won't instruct you on how to write your will or get divorced, but it will educate you at a more systematic level. It is also a great read. <i>--J.R.</i></p><br><strong>Jay M. Feinman</strong> is Distinguished Professor of Law at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, School of Law at Camden.

Remarkably sophisticated, orcas have languages and cultures and even long-term memories, and their capacity for echolocation is nothing short of a sixth sense. They are also benign and gentle, which makes the story of the captive-orca industry&#x2015;and the endangerment of their population in Puget Sound&#x2015;that much more damning.&nbsp; &nbsp; In Of Orcas and Men, a marvelously compelling mix of cultural history, environmental reporting, and scientific research, David Neiwert explores an extraordinary species and its occasionally fraught relationship with human beings. Beginning with their role in myth and contemporary popular culture, Neiwert shows how killer whales came to capture our imaginations, and brings to life the often catastrophic environmental consequences of that appeal.&nbsp; &nbsp; In the tradition of Barry Lopez&#x2019;s classic Of Wolves and Men, David Neiwert&#x2019;s book is a triumph of reporting, observation, and research, and a powerful tribute to one of the animal kingdom&#x2019;s most remarkable members.</p><p>David Neiwert is an investigative journalist based in Seattle.

But in a melee of language and blood, their stories and the stories of those they meet&#x2014;of a young serial killer, a waitress and graphic novelist and her lover (and former professor), and an outsider artist in a mental institution&#x2014;gradually begin to coalesce. Daring in both its protagonists and its structure, Edmundo Paz Sold�n&#x2019;s <i>Norte</i> is a fast-paced, vivid, and operatic blending of distinct voices. Together, they lay bare the darkness of the line over which these souls&#x2014;like so many others&#x2014;have passed.<br> <br> A prominent member of a new generation of Latin American writers, Paz Sold�n stands in defiant opposition to the magical realism of the past century, instead grounding his work in political, economic, and historical realities. <i>Norte</i> is no exception; it is a tale of displacement and the very human costs of immigration. Shocking with its violence even as it thrills with its language, confounding rather than cowering under the clich� of the murderous, drug-dealing immigrant, <i>Norte</i> is a disquieting, imperative work&#x2014;an undeniable reflection of our fragmented modern world.</p></p><p>Born in Bolivia, <b>Edmundo Paz Sold�n </b>is professor of Latin American literature at Cornell University.

With unflinching realism and steely grace, <i>Norte </i>reminds us why literature can do what journalism cannot: We inhabit the minds of people we&#x2019;d prefer to forget.&#x201d; (Lili Wright, author of "Dancing with the Tiger" <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>One of Kirkus's Best Books of 2016 (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>"The lives of a mentally ill savant, a young artist, and a serial killer converge in a powerful novel that shuttles across the US&#x2013;Mexico border.

But <i>Norte</i>'s key strength is its well-formed individual characterizations. . . . Paz Sold�n effectively inhabits the interior lives of each of his three characters, and Miles&#x2019;s translation captures their distinct emotional flavors. . . . A superb set of interlinked character studies." (<i>Kirkus Reviews, starred review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Norte</i> is a rare book because it&#x2019;s about immigrants and heavily focused on the act of immigration, but neither of the immigrant characters are held up as models. . . . This tangled, daring novel isn&#x2019;t just about violence&#x2014;it&#x2019;s about roaming, missing home, and trying to find a place in the world. . . . Paz Sold�n is part of a new breed of writers from Latin America: fascinated by America, aware of its contradictions, concerned with the role of immigrants in our society, but not willing to go over the same well-trod narrative ground. <i>Norte</i> isn&#x2019;t your typical immigrant story, but that&#x2019;s what makes it all the more powerful.&#x201d; (Richard Z.

In truth his work is so multifaceted that any single classification disserves him. . . . [This is] a sterling translation by editor and translator Miles. It traces three thematically interlocked narratives of Latin Americans who have made the border crossing and, to quote the author, have become &#x2018;lost in the US.&#x2019; Containing elements of popular pulp fiction, academic satire, metafiction, and psychological realism, it is a riveting book that gives a complex perspective on the borderlands shared by the United States and Mexico.&#x201d; (Scott Esposito <i>BOMB</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;These voices speak of displacement, grief, and loss, the result of the painful tension between the cultural self and the smothering seduction of the United States, <i>el Norte</i>. . . .

What I find so appealing about <i>Norte</i> is that Paz Sold�n makes no attempt to sugarcoat the grim and persistent realities he portrays about immigrants who face being 'one more digit in a disposable labor force . . . at the cost of living without dreams.' He clearly asserts that the struggle against <i>perder</i><i> el norte </i>is an arduous process of keeping one&#x2019;s soul on the immigrant journey; his novel is but one stop on that journey.&#x201d; (Russell J. MacMullan Jr. <i>Washington Independent Review of Books</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Jes�s is the dynamo powering Paz Sold�n&#x2019;s impressive and multifaceted novel <i>Norte</i>, which has just been released under the same title in Valerie Miles&#x2019;s excellent translation. Told in three thematically linked but non-intersecting narratives involving Mexicans swallowed up by the US from the 1930s to the present day, the book gives a complex psychological portrait of the border&#x2019;s push/pull, delving into the calamities that have made America so seductive to Mexicans, but also the factors that make this a fraught escape. Paz Sold�n is a natural storyteller, giving a vivid, blistering account. . . . With such insights, Paz Sold�n offers a fresh view on what can seem like an endlessly discussed place&#x2014;and one likely to be in the news even more frequently under the presidency of Donald Trump.&#x201d; (Scott Esposito <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Different points of view can be distracting, but a skilled author establishes characters with distinct voices to ensure each gets the attention he or she deserves. . . . Paz Sold�n astutely links the lives of these full-blooded people throughout the full-color world of <i>Norte</i>. . . . Paz Sold�n maneuvers easily between&nbsp;the minds of these characters, himself crossing borders into different psyches and varying states of sanity to illustrate how traumatic displacement can be. The language often flourishes even when the scene is most solemn. . . . <i>Norte</i>&nbsp;treats&nbsp;the issue of immigration as something beyond&nbsp;the ways in which&nbsp;man-made boundaries become enforceable dividing lines between people and nations. Its characters experience internal struggles that arise from movement and place, but their struggles are what make them more than mere characters on a page.&#x201d; (Aaron Coats <i>Chicago Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"Dramatic and provocative. . . . Paz Sold�n&#x2019;s style is bold and realistic. . . . Translator Miles, who adds a long 'Translator&#x2019;s Note' at the end of the novel, provides great insight into the many different 'voices' of the characters here and the difficulty of translating these into English when they are so different from each other in Spanish. . . . And she has done a masterful job." (Mary Whipple <i>Seeing the World through Books</i>)<br><br>"Set in what translator Miles calls a 'space of the imagination,' Paz Sold�n's <i>Norte</i> uncovers its characters' complicated relationships to expression and the trappings of readymade discourses. . . . The distance between the value they assign to others' lives and the lack they associate with their own renders a dissonance that can be characterized with the word <i>ajeno</i>. Roughly meaning 'alien to onself,' <i>ajeno</i> best approximates the novel's haunting depiction of the experience of migration, even in the best of circumstances, and expresses the forces of creation and destruction it unleashes."

He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367&#x2013;47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias&#x2019;s relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343&#x2013;2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip&#x2019;s death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of &#x201c;Peripatetics&#x201d;), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander&#x2019;s death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322.Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious).

We know&#x2014;or think we know&#x2014;that Eisenhower distrusted his vice president, Richard Nixon, and kept him at arm&#x2019;s length; that he did little to advance civil rights; that he sat by as Joseph McCarthy&#x2019;s reckless anticommunist campaign threatened to wreck his administration; and that he planned the disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba. None of this is true.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>The President and the Apprentice</i> reveals a different Eisenhower, and a different Nixon. Ike trusted and relied on Nixon, sending him on many sensitive overseas missions. Eisenhower, not Truman, completed the desegregation of the military. Eisenhower and Nixon, not Lyndon Johnson, pushed the Civil Rights Act of 1957 through the Senate. Eisenhower was determined to bring down McCarthy and did so. Nixon never, contrary to recent accounts, saw a psychotherapist, but while Ike was recovering from his heart attack in 1955, Nixon was overworked, overanxious, overmedicated, and at the limits of his ability to function.<br> &nbsp;<br> Based on twenty years of research in numerous archives, many previously untouched, this book offers a fresh and surprising account of the Eisenhower presidency.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Irwin Gellman&#x2019;s superb research and plausible reconstruction of the Eisenhower-Nixon relationship may well revolutionize the meaning of historical revisionism. <i>The&nbsp;President and the Apprentice</i> is an unsettling&nbsp;<i>tour de force.</i>&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;</b>David Levering Lewis, author of <i>King: A Biography</i> and <i>W.E.B.

Paul Getty Museum</h2><p>Hungarian born Moholy-Nagy (1895-1946) was influential not only as a photographer but also as a filmmaker, teacher, and painter. He taught at the Bauhaus in Germany and, after fleeing the Nazi regime, settled in Chicago, where he founded the Institute of Design. He pioneered the photomontage and created the camera-less medium of the "photogram." This book, the second in the Getty's <em>In Focus</em> series, features sixty reproductions from the Getty's outstanding collection of this important photographer's work--each described by Katherine Ware of the Museum's department of photographs. The book also includes the edited transcript of a recent colloquium that provides the historical and critical perspective necessary for understanding Moholy-Nagy's vital contribution to twentieth-century art. The colloquium participants were Charles Hagan, Thomas Barrow, Jeannine Fiedler, Leland Rice, Hattula Moholy-Nagy, and Weston Naef and Katherine Ware.</p><p>Laszlo Moholy-Nagy (1895-1946) was a painter, sculptor, filmmaker, writer, graphic and stage designer, teacher, and photographer. Working in his native Hungary as well as in Germany, Holland, England, and the United States, Moholy-Nagy constantly experimented in these various fields, leaving a remarkable legacy of innovation. The J. Paul Getty Museum owns eighty-two photographs by Moholy-Nagy, almost fifty of which are presented in this volume, the second in the Museum&#39;s In Focus series on photographers. The plates are accompanied by commentaries by Katherine Ware, Assistant Curator in the Department of Photographs. Ms. Ware, along with Thomas Barrow, Jeannine Fiedler, Charles Hagen, Hattula Moholy-Nagy, Weston Naef, and Leland Rice, participated in a colloquium on the life and work of Moholy-Nagy at the Museum in 1994. An edited transcript of this discussion and a chronology of significant events in the artist&#39;s life are also included in this book.In 1937, painter, theorist, and photographer Moholy-Nagy brought his ideas and teaching to Chicago, where they influenced more than one generation of photographers. But his death at 51 cut off the stream of his work, and now photographers know his early writings on photography--he was the great twentieth-century theorist of the medium's possibilities--better than the images themselves. The Getty Museum corrects that situation by publishing 45 photographs with useful commentaries by curator Katherine Ware about his methods, themes, and social context. Moholy-Nagy wrote that the photogram (an image made on light-sensitive paper without a camera) was the most photographic work, yet his most interesting pieces are his <i>fotoplastiks</i> witty collages of photographic fragments set in imaginary spaces suggested by spare, geometric drawings. Twenty-five appear here and demonstrate Moholy-Nagy's ability to comment, with great visual elegance, on topics ranging from militarism and racism to sexual tension and marriage. The only cavil is that the small scale of reproduction here prevents easy reading of many of the details. <i>Gretchen Garner</i></p><h2>The Cartoon Guide to (Non) Communication : The Use and Misuse of Information in the Modern World</h2><p>From the author of the extraordinary bestseller <em>The Cartoon History of the Universe</em> (150,000 copies sold)--an all-new cartoon guide effectively analyzing the ambiguous relationship between language and meaning in today's information age.</p><p><p>Larry Gonick has been creating comics that explain math, history, science, and other big subjects for more than forty years.

It also serves as a major contribution to the history of tarot. <p>First published in 1988, The Jungian Tarot and Its Archetypal Imagery is intended to be a visual introduction to Jungian philosophy. The key is the archetypal image encountered through creative visualization or, as Jung called it, "active imagination." It is a process which may, theoretically, lead to discovery of a true Inner Self. Such creative visualization is at the heart of all mystical and religious systems, from those of the ancient world, to the spiritual exercises of Ignatius Loyola, to Hermeticism and Rosicrucianism, to Alchemy, and to the remarkably creative occult exercises of the nineteenth century. </p><p>Those familiar with Dr. Wang&#x2019;s earlier work, The Qabalistic Tarot, will be comfortable with his attribution of tarot cards to that central diagram, the Tree of Life. Wang considers this glyph to represent a hierarchy of archetypes and, indeed, a sort of road map of the collective unconscious. One of his main efforts in this exploration of Jungian philosophy is to demonstrate parallels between it and Hermetic Kabbalah, a system which has been essential to Western mysticism since the Italian Renaissance. </p><p>Wang explores Jung's ideas about regressions from the personal into the collective and considers them to be commensurate with the Kabbalistic method of working backwards from the lowest level of the Tree of Life (the material condition), through the upper levels which symbolize not only the enlightened Self, but a condition of non-being which transcends all consciousness, personal or collective. </p><p>This book also attempts to address a loose correlation of pantheons, under the file categories provided by tarot. It may be argued that ideas which emerge repeatedly across cultural boundaries lend credence to the postulate of archetypes which, in the minds of most people, is merely an interesting and remote theory. Wang is of the opinion that to rapidly skim across ancient concepts of, for example, a mother goddess, is to consider the various faces of the Mother archetype represented in tarot as The Empress. And, again, the main reason for making such a comparison is to determine if the "true" nature of an archetype is revealed by those areas where far-removed cultures have deities with similar qualities. In this regard, the earliest mythologies seem to be the most useful. </p><p>Just as Carl Jung brought the overview of a scientist to the age-old question of man's potential for self-knowledge, Wang has used his background as an art historian to explore how Jung wanted to understand the nature of consciousness, and&#x2014;ultimately&#x2014;to solve the problem which so engaged the Greeks, the relationship between the one and the many.</p>As an art historian, my amateur incursion into comparative religion is very tentative and my sources are general. I should also admit that as a historian I have a specific bias. History is, to me, something secure against which religious, mythological, and psychological ideologies must be measured, and it bothers me to find so many discussions of the history of tarot predicated upon irresponsible speculation (one of the unfortunate legacies of eighteenth-century romanticism), especially when the historical tracks of the cards are so clear. <p>Of course interpretation of the tarot in serious psychological terms would have seemed laughable, if not absolutely bizarre to its originators, who developed the cards as a game! It was not until the late nineteenth century that tarot was systematically related to Astrology, to Kabbalah, and to Alchemy. And it was the twentieth century which added an overlay of modern psychological theory. </p><p>Finally, let me say that this work, which is predicated on Jung's rather remarkable methodology, is in no way intended to present a belief system. Nothing except the historical facts should be taken at face value. The exercise of dealing with each of the tarot keys as an archetypal image is meant to stimulate thought about the nature of consciousness and about the root causes of the human condition.</p></p><h2>Learn to Sign the Fun Way: Let Your Fingers Do the Talking with Games, Puzzles, and Activities in American Sign Language</h2><p><b>The perfect guide to signing for everyone!<br></b><br> Never before has learning to sign been so simple and so much fun!

Clytemnestra rules Mycenae now, along with her new lover Aegisthus, and together they plot the bloody murder of Agamemnon on the day of his return after nine years at war.<br> <br> Judged, despised, cursed by gods, Clytemnestra reveals the tragic saga that led to these bloody actions: how her husband deceived her eldest daughter Iphigeneia with a promise of marriage to Achilles, only to sacrifice her; how she seduced and collaborated with the prisoner Aegisthus; how Agamemnon came back with a lover himself; and how Clytemnestra finally achieved her vengeance for his stunning betrayal&#x2014;his quest for victory, greater than his love for his child.<br> <br> <i>House of Names</i> &#x201c;is a disturbingly contemporary story of a powerful woman caught between the demands of her ambition and the constraints on her gender...Never before has T�ib�n demonstrated such range,&#x201d; (<i>The Washington Post). </i> He brings a modern sensibility and language to an ancient classic, and gives this extraordinary character new life, so that we not only believe Clytemnestra&#x2019;s thirst for revenge, but applaud it. Told in four parts, this is a fiercely dramatic portrait of a murderess, who will herself be murdered by her own son, Orestes. It is Orestes&#x2019;s story, too: his capture by the forces of his mother&#x2019;s lover Aegisthus, his escape and his exile. And it is the story of the vengeful Electra, who watches over her mother and Aegisthus with cold anger and slow calculation, until, on the return of her brother, she has the fates of both of them in her hands.</p><p>Colm T�ib�n is the author of nine novels, including <i>The Blackwater Lightship</i>; <i>The Master</i>, winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Prize; <i>Brooklyn</i>, winner of the Costa Book Award; <i>The Testament of Mary</i>; and <i>Nora Webster</i>, as well as two story collections, and <i>Mad, Bad, Dangerous to Know</i>, a look at three nineteenth-century Irish authors.

In the face of the Modern Age, Stickley espoused the values of the medieval craftsman, influencing the design of furniture, pottery, metalwork, jewelry, bookbinding, leatherwork, and architecture. Author Barry Sanders chronicles the progress of Stickley's wide-ranging career, from his rise to fame and wealth to his ultimate financial ruin. Rare photographs and renderings of Stickley's designs enhance this compelling portrait of the man and his work.</p> <p>It was a time of enormous upheaval in America. Sweeping and convulsive changes spilled into the new century in every conceivable shape: electric lights, overhead railways, airplanes, automobiles, the Ashcan school of painting, jazz, and Henry James. Yet, in the middle of this time of intense innovation, a movement dedicated to simple living began to take shape. It became known as the Craftsman Movement, and an unknown cabinetmaker, Gustav Stickley, became its most vocal spokesman, and in many ways, its embodiment.</p> <p>A Complex Fate chronicles Stickley's life and career&#x2014;a career marked by the same contradictions that characterized America's transition from a largely rural society to a modern, technological one. He regarded himself as a modern, yet espoused a philosophy that celebrated simplicity, community, and skilled manual work. His furniture itself, at first glance simple, stark, and hand-built, was nevertheless mass-produced and regarded as thoroughly modern by a public eager to buy it.</p> <p>In this, the first full-length profile of Stickley, we follow his rise to staggering wealth, wide popularity, and enormous influence on the design of furniture, pottery, metalwork, jewelry, book-binding, leatherwork, and architecture. We see the power of his charisma and uncommon ego, his plans for rural crafts schools, and his messianic drive to spread the message of artisanship, community, and honest, unalienated labor. We watch, too, as his ambitions and contradictions finally become overwhelming, leaving him a bankrupt and broken man.</p> <p>A Complex Fate is the robust portrait of a man whose talent, nerve, and savvy have left a lasting imprint on design in America, and whose life offers us a window on the roiling tumult of a society on the brink of a new age.</p></p><p>A compelling biography of Gustav Stickley, once an unknown cabinetmaker, who became the most vocal spokesman in America for the quirky revolution in aesthetics known as the Arts and Crafts Movement. Chronicles the progress of Stickley&#39;s wide-ranging artistic career in which he sought to integrate social theory, political commitment and aesthetic design. Stickley&#39;s story is the story of a movement that exerted tremendous influence on furniture, pottery, metal work, jewelry, bookbinding, leatherwork and architecture. Includes photographs of rare works along with his renderings of early designs.BARRY SANDERS is Professor of English and the History of Ideas at Pitzer College in Claremont, California.

In Storytelling for Grantseekers, consultant and trainer Cheryl A. Clarke helps fundraisers overcome these hurdles by presenting an organic approach to proposal writing. Grantseekers who have used this unique process discover that telling the organization's story in narrative form (complete with settings, characters, antagonists, and resolutions), can help them connect with grantmakers and ultimately have greater success with funders.<br> <br> This fresh and creative guide contains the resources needed to help you craft a persuasive synopsis, package a compelling story, and create a short story approach to the inquiry and cover letters that support the larger proposal. Clarke walks grantseekers through all the phases of developing an effective proposal and highlights the creative elements that link components to each other and unify the entire proposal. Clarke also stresses the need to see proposal writing as part of a larger grantseeking effort, one that emphasizes preparation, working with the entire development staff, and maintaining good relations with funders.<br> <br> Using the suggestions outlined in Storytelling for Grantseekers, new and seasoned grantseekers will discover how to channel their passion to tell their organization's tale and create winning proposals.</p><p>Grantwriters, it turns out, have plenty in common with fiction and nonfiction storytellers. Like these other writers, says Cheryl A. Clarke in <i>Storytelling for Grantseekers</i>, grantseekers need to "transport readers to another location and teach them about people they may know nothing about." Grantwriting is often a tedious experience. Make it creative, says Clarke. To better capture the imagination (and wallet) of your audience, observe your agency in action as would a reporter, then craft what you see into a narrative as would a novelist. Your nonprofit agency is your hero; your story is about "people being helped, and their lives possibly being changed forever" because of the services provided by your agency. This is a passionate, clear, knowledgeable guidebook, sure to "put the joy and creativity back into the grantseeking process." With additional chapters on finding and cultivating appropriate grantmakers, forming a budget, and packaging your proposal. <i>--Jane Steinberg</i>"The author of <i>Storytelling for Grantseekers</i> is to be heartily congratulated! It's about time that grantwriting was discussed as a creative process rather than a technical chore. This book is destined to be a classic." <br> --Bill J. Harrison, CFRE, director of fund development, Blood Systems, Inc., Scottsdale, Arizona <p> "In a lucid and entertaining style which reveals her own accomplishments as a grantwriter and storyteller, Cheryl Clarke takes the reader on the step-by-step adventure of putting together an effective grant proposal." <br> --Dorotea Reyna, director of corporate and foundation relations, Dominican University, San Rafael, California </p><p> "Cheryl Clarke's book sets the bar higher for grantwriters, encouraging them to look at the process of writing grant requests in a new way. As a program officer for several family foundations, I am delighted at the thought of the proposals that will result: powerful stories containing all the information I need." (Mary Lowrey Gregory, program officer, Pacific Foundation Services, San Francisco, California) </p><p></p></p><h2>Kickstarting Your Academic Career: Skills to Succeed in the Social Sciences</h2><p><em>Kickstarting Your Academic Career</em> is a primer on the common scholastic demands that social sciences students face upon entering college or university.

MacLeod lives with his family in the West Midlands of England.</i></p> <p><i>Here he tells an evocative and emotionally powerful story of someone sent on a mission to a virtual utopia reserved only for the superrich who have died on our mundane Earth, a sort of literal afterlife. It&#x2019;s a smart, tense, and tricky story in which the stakes are high and nothing is what it seems.</i></p> <p>The trees of Farside are incredible. Fireash and oak. Greenbloom and maple. Shot through with every colour of autumn as late afternoon sunlight blazes over the Seven Mountains&#x2019; white peaks. He&#x2019;d never seen such beauty as this when he was alive.</p> <p>The virtual Bentley takes the bridge over the next gorge at a tyrescream, then speeds on through crimson and gold. Another few miles, and he&#x2019;s following the coastal road beside the Westering Ocean. The sands are burnished, the rocks silver-threaded. Every new vista a fabulous creation. Then ahead, just as purple glower sweeps in from his rear-view over those dragon-haunted mountains, come the silhouette lights of a vast castle, high up on a ridge. It&#x2019;s the only habitation he&#x2019;s seen in hours.</p> <p>This has to be it.</p> <p>Northover lets the rise of the hill pull at the Bentley&#x2019;s impetus as its headlights sweep the driveway trees. Another turn, another glimpse of a headland, and there&#x2019;s Elsinore again, rising dark and sheer.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>He tries to refuse the offer to carry his luggage made by the neat little creature that emerges into the lamplit courtyard to greet him with clipboard, sharp shoes and lemony smile. He&#x2019;s encountered many chimeras by now. The shop assistants, the street cleaners, the crew on the steamer ferry that brought him here. All substantially humanoid, and invariably polite, although amended as necessary to perform their tasks, and far stranger to his mind than the truly dead.</p> <p>He follows a stairway up through rough-hewn stone. The thing&#x2019;s name is Kasaya. Ah, now. The east wing. I think you&#x2019;ll find what we have here more than adequate. If not&nbsp;&#x2026; Well, you <i>must</i> promise to let me know. And this is called the Willow Room. And <i>do</i> enjoy your stay&nbsp;&#x2026; </p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Northover wanders. Northover touches. Northover breathes. The interior of this large high-ceilinged suite with its crackling applewood fire and narrow, deep-set windows is done out in an elegantly understated arts-and-craftsy style. Amongst her many attributes, Thea Lorentz always did have excellent taste.</p> <p>What&#x2019;s struck him most about Farside since he jerked into new existence on the bed in the cabin of that ship bound for New Erin is how unremittingly <i>real</i> everything seems. But the slick feel of this patterned silk bedthrow&nbsp;&#x2026; The spiky roughness of the teasels in the flower display&nbsp;&#x2026; He&#x2019;s given up telling himself that everything he&#x2019;s experiencing is just some clever construct. The thing about it, the thing that makes it all so impossibly overwhelming, is that <i>he&#x2019;s</i> here as well. Dead, but alive. The evidence of his corpse doubtless already incinerated, but his consciousness&#x2014;the singularity of his existence, what philosophers once called &#x201c;the conscious I,&#x201d; and theologians the soul, along with his memories and personality, the whole sense of self which had once inhabited pale jelly in his skull&#x2014;transferred.</p> <p>The bathroom is no surprise to him now. The dead do so many things the living do, so why not piss and shit as well? He strips and stands in the shower&#x2019;s warm blaze. He soaps, rinses. Reminds himself of what he must do, and say. He&#x2019;d been warned that he&#x2019;d soon become attracted to the blatant glories of this world, along with the new, young man&#x2019;s body he now inhabits. Better just to accept it that rather than fight. All that matters is that he holds to the core of his resolve.</p> <p>He towels himself dry. He pulls back on his watch&#x2014;seemingly a Rolex, but a steel model, neatly unostentatious&#x2014;and winds it carefully. He dresses. Hangs up his clothes in a walnut panelled wardrobe that smells faintly of mothballs, and hears a knock at the doors just as he slides his case beneath the bed.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes? Come in&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>When he turns, he&#x2019;s expecting another chimera servant. But it&#x2019;s Thea Lorentz.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>This, too, is something they&#x2019;d tried to prepare him for. But encountering her after so long is much less of a shock than he&#x2019;s been expecting. Thea&#x2019;s image is as ubiquitous as that of Marilyn Monroe or the Virgin Mary back on Lifeside, and she really hasn&#x2019;t changed. She&#x2019;s dressed in a loose-fitting shirt. Loafers and slacks. Hair tied back. No obvious evidence of any make-up. But the crisp white shirt with its rolled up cuffs shows her dark brown skin to perfection, and one lose strand of her tied back hair plays teasingly at her sculpted neck. A tangle of silver bracelets slide on her wrist as she steps forward to embrace him. Her breasts are unbound and she still smells warmly of the patchouli she always used to favour. Everything about her feels exactly the same. But why not? After all, she was already perfect when she was alive.</p> <p>&#x201c;Well&#x2026;!&#x201d; That warm blaze is still in her eyes, as well. &#x201c;It really <i>is</i> you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know I&#x2019;m springing a huge surprise. Just turning up from out of nowhere like this.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I can take these kind of surprises any day! And I hear it&#x2019;s only been&#x2014;what?&#x2014;less than a week since you transferred. Everything must feel so very strange to you still.&#x201d;</p> <p>It went without saying that his and Thea&#x2019;s existences had headed off in different directions back on Lifeside. She, of course, had already been well on her way toward some or other kind of immortality when they&#x2019;d lost touch. And he&nbsp;&#x2026; Well, it was just one of those stupid lucky breaks. A short, ironic keyboard riff he&#x2019;d written to help promote some old online performance thing&#x2014;no, no, it was nothing she&#x2019;d been involved in&#x2014;had ended up being picked up many years later as the standard message-send fail signal on the global net. Yeah, that was the one. Of course, Thea knew it. Everyone, once they thought about it for a moment, did.</p> <p>&#x201c;You know, Jon,&#x201d; she says, her voice more measured now, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re the one person I thought would never choose to make this decision. None of us can pretend that being Farside isn&#x2019;t a position of immense privilege, when most of the living can&#x2019;t afford food, shelter, good health. You always were a man of principle, and I sometimes thought you&#x2019;d just fallen to&nbsp;&#x2026; Well, the same place that most performers fall to, I suppose, which is no particular place at all. I even considered trying to find you and get in touch, offer&#x2026;&#x201d; She gestures around her. &#x201c;Well, this. But you wouldn&#x2019;t have taken it, would you? Not on those terms.&#x201d;</p> <p>He shakes his head. In so many ways she still has him right. He detested&#x2014;no, he quietly reminds himself&#x2014;<i>detests</i> everything about this vast vampiric sham of a world that sucks life, hope and power from the living. But she hadn&#x2019;t come to him, either, had she? Hadn&#x2019;t offered what she now so casually calls <i>this</i>. For all her fame, for all her good works, for all the aid funds she sponsors and the good causes she promotes, Thea Lorentz and the rest of the dead have made no effort to extend their constituency beyond the very rich, and almost certainly never will. After all, why should they? Would the gods invite the merely mortal to join them on Mount Olympus?</p> <p>She smiles and steps close to him again. Weights both his hands in her own. &#x201c;Most people I know, Jon&#x2014;most of those I have to meet and talk to and deal with, and even those I have to call friends&#x2014;they all think that I&#x2019;m Thea Lorentz. Both Farside and Lifeside, it&#x2019;s long been the same. But only you and a very few others really know who I am. You can&#x2019;t imagine how precious and important it is to have you here&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>He stands gazing at the door after she&#x2019;s left. Willing everything to dissolve, fade, crash, melt. But nothing changes. He&#x2019;s still dead. He&#x2019;s still standing here in this Farside room. Can still even breathe the faint patchouli of Thea&#x2019;s scent. He finishes dressing&#x2014;a tie, a jacket, the same supple leather shoes he arrived in&#x2014;and heads out into the corridor.</p> <p>Elsinore really is <i>big</i>&#x2014;and resolutely, heavily, emphatically, the ancient building it wishes to be. Cold gusts pass along its corridors. Heavy doors groan and creak. Of course, the delights of Farside are near-infinite. He&#x2019;s passed through forests of mist and silver. Seen the vast, miles-wide back of some great island of a seabeast drift past when he was still out at sea. The dead can grow wings, sprout gills, spread roots into the soil and raise their arms and become trees. All these things are not only possible, but visibly, virtually, achievably real. But he thinks they still hanker after life, and all the things of life the living, for all their disadvantages, possess.</p> <p>He passes many fine-looking paintings as he descends the stairs. They have a Pre-Raphaelite feel, and from the little he knows of art, seem finely executed, but he doesn&#x2019;t recognise any of them. Have these been created by virtual hands, in some virtual workshop, or have they simply sprung into existence? And what would happen if he took that sword which also hangs on display, and slashed it through a canvas? Would it be gone for ever? Almost certainly not. One thing he knows for sure about the Farside&#x2019;s vast database is that it&#x2019;s endlessly backed up, scattered, diffused and re-collated across many secure and heavily armed vaults back in what&#x2019;s left of the world of the living. There are very few guaranteed ways of destroying any of it, least of all the dead.</p> <p>Further down, there are holo-images, all done in stylish black and white. Somehow, even in a castle, they don&#x2019;t even look out of place. Thea, as always, looks like she&#x2019;s stepped out of a fashion-shoot. The dying jungle suits her. As does this war-zone, and this flooded hospital, and this burnt-out shanty town. The kids, and it is mostly kids, who surround her with their pot bellies and missing limbs, somehow manage to absorb a little of her glamour. On these famous trips of hers back to view the suffering living, she makes an incredibly beautiful ghost.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Two big fires burn in Elsinore&#x2019;s great hall, and there&#x2019;s a long table for dinner, and the heads of many real and mythic creatures loom upon the walls. Basilisk, boar, unicorn&nbsp;&#x2026; Hardly noticing the chimera servant who rakes his chair out for him, Northover sits down. Thea&#x2019;s space at the top of the table is still empty.</p> <p>In this Valhalla where the lucky, eternal dead feast forever, what strikes Northover most strongly is the sight of Sam Bartleby sitting beside Thea&#x2019;s vacant chair. Not that he doesn&#x2019;t know that the man has been part of what&#x2019;s termed <i>Thea Lorentz&#x2019;s inner circle</i> for more than a decade. But, even when they were all still alive and working together on <i>Bard On Wheels</i>, he&#x2019;d never been able to understand why she put up with him. Of course, Bartleby made his fortune with those ridiculous action virtuals, but the producers deepened his voice so much, and enhanced his body so ridiculously, that it was a wonder to Northover they bothered to use him at all. Now, though, he&#x2019;s chosen to bulk himself out and cut his hair in a Roman fringe. He senses Northover&#x2019;s gaze, and raises his glass, and gives an ironic nod. He still has the self-regarding manner of someone who thinks themselves far more better looking, not to mention cleverer, than they actually are.</p> <p>Few of the dead, though, choose to be beautiful. Most elect for the look that expresses themselves at what they thought of as the most fruitful and self-expressive period of their lives. Amongst people this wealthy, this often equates to late middle age. The fat, the bald, the matronly and the downright ugly rub shoulders, secure in the knowledge that they can become young and beautiful again whenever they wish.</p> <p>&#x201c;So? What are you here for?&#x201d;</p> <p>The woman beside him already seems flushed from the wine, and has a homely face and a dimpled smile, although she sports pointed teeth, elfin ears and her eyes are cattish slots.</p> <p>&#x201c;For?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Name&#x2019;s Wilhelmina Howard. People just call me Will&#x2026;&#x201d; She offers him a claw-nailed hand to shake. &#x201c;Made my money doing windfarm recycling in the non-federal states.

Will the process continue in the twenty-first century or has it ended? What does this mean for the people who live there? Can they do anything about it?<br> This book challenges conventional wisdom, which holds gentrification to be the simple outcome of new middle-class tastes and a demand for urban living. It reveals gentrification as part of a much larger shift in the political economy and culture of the late twentieth century. Documenting in gritty detail the conflicts that gentrification brings to the new urban 'frontiers', the author explores the interconnections of urban policy, patterns of investment, eviction, and homelessness.<br> The failure of liberal urban policy and the end of the 1980s financial boom have made the end-of-the-century city a darker and more dangerous place. Public policy and the private market are conspiring against minorities, working people, the poor, and the homeless as never before. In the emerging revanchist city, gentrification has become part of this policy of revenge.</p><p>Neil Smith is professor of Geography and acting Director of the Center for the Critical Analysis of Contemporary Culture.

Rather than simply listing and describing the standard topics, the principles provide a framework for integrating them into a consistent and coherent understanding of all social psychology and behavior. This has an enormously positive effect on how the subject can be taught and on how it is understood by students. </p> <p>--<b>Jeffrey Sherman, Professor of Psychology, University of California-Davis</b></p> <p>I use this textbook in my courses because not only is it well-written, it also highlights basic principles and themes rather than focusing on specific phenomena and effects. Rather than discussing each topic in isolation, Smith, Mackie, and Claypool explicitly link them together within and between chapters using these cross-cutting principles and themes. This provides students with a very useful conceptual framework or scaffold with which to understand and integrate what often appears to be an overwhelming amount of information. Many of my students have commented to me that this focus on basic principles was instrumental and valuable in their learning and understanding of the field.</p><b> <p>--Kentaro Fujita, Associate Professor of Psychology, Ohio State University</p></b> <p>This authoritative introduction to the science of social psychology constitutes a high-quality review of the social and social-cognitive processes pertaining to how people perceive and influence other individuals and other groups. Introducing fundamental axioms and core motivational and processing principles to the study of individuals and groups, the book bridges the boundaries between different traditions on how to approach the exciting discipline of social psychology. In this way, the book is a true invitation to the fascinating study of human social behavior and its underlying psychological processes.</p><b> <p>--Kees van den Bos, Professor of Social Psychology Including the Social Psychology of Organizations and</p> <p>Professor of Empirical Legal Science, Utrecht University</p></b> <p>I have been using this Social Psychology textbook since its first edition. Why? Because it is simply the best. It is thoughtful while still being fascinating. It covers classic research while still being completely up-to-date on new discoveries. It emphasizes ideas while still appreciating the research behind them. And, most important to me, it organizes social psychology in terms of the basic principles that underlie multiple phenomena at the personal, interpersonal, and group levels. Not easy to do...and brilliantly done.</p><b> <p>--E. Tory Higgins, Stanley Schachter Professor of Psychology and Professor of Business, Columbia University</p></b> <p>This is a book not just for students of social psychology, or of the wider discipline of psychology: it is, rather, a book that speaks to students and practitioners in any field or profession concerned with our social interactions and identities. More than simply an academic textbook, it forms a clear and accessible applied guide for negotiating the complexities of the social world around us. In this new edition, Smith, Mackie and Claypool have continued to build their substantive and cohesive account of social psychology that brings together a range of classic experiments and theories with the most up-to-date research in the field.</p> <p><strong>--Thomas Grimwood, Program Leader for MA in Social Work, University of Cumbria</strong></p> <p>I've used the previous versions of this textbook for years and I think this is an excellent introduction to social psychology. The book offers an integrative approach throughout the chapters that connects them to one another, rather than treating the various research areas of social psychology as disparate and unrelated. In contrast to many other textbooks, the Smith, Mackie, and Claypool textbook pays homage to the work of social psychologists across the globe and contains a separate chapter on social identity. This new edition has been updated and includes recent developments in the field of social psychology. I highly recommend this textbook.</p> <p><strong>--Arjan Bos, Associate Professor of Psychology, Open University, the Netherlands</strong></p></p><h2>PRENTICE HALL MATH GEOMETRY STUDY GUIDE AND PRACTICE WORKBOOK 2004C</h2><p>Prentice Hall Mathematics offers comprehensive math content coverage, introduces basic mathematics concepts and skills, and provides numerous opportunities to access basic skills along with abundant remediation and intervention activities.</p><p></p><h2>1001 Chess Exercises for Club Players: The Tactics Workbook that Also Explains All Key Concepts</h2><p>Chess is 99% tactics. This celebrated observation is not only true for beginners, but also for club players (Elo 1500 &#x2013; 2000). If you want to win more games, nothing works better than training your combination skills. There are two types of books on tactics: those that introduce the concepts followed by some examples, and workbooks that contain lots of exercises. FIDE Master Frank Erwich has done both: he explains all key tactical ideas AND provides an enormous amount of exercises for each different theme. Erwich has created a complete tactics book for ambitious club and tournament players. He teaches you how to reach the next level of identifying weak spots in the position of your opponent, recognizing patterns of combinations, visualizing tricks and calculating effectively. Erwich has also included a new and important element: tests that will improve your defensive skills. 1001 Chess Exercises for Club Players is not a collection of freewheeling puzzles. It serves as a course text book, because only the most didactically productive exercises are featured. Every chapter starts with easy examples, but no worries: the level of difficulty will steadily increase.</p><p>Frank Erwich is a FIDE Master and an experienced chess trainer from The Netherlands."An extremely useful training manual. Many club players will benefit." (Herman Grooten, International Master <i>Shaaksite</i>)<br><br>"Good work! Lots of exercises, not many words, just what I like. The chapter on defense, in particular, is very clever. One is so accustomed to attacking combinations, but tactics can be used in defense as well." (Simen Agdestein, Grandmaster <i>VG Daily News</i>)<br><br>"I was very impressed by the range of positions that Erwich selected. A good book of its kind! Four stars!" (Matthew Sadler, Grandmaster, award-winning author of 'Chess for Life')<br><br>"The material at the beginning of each chapter is clearly explained; the exercises which follow will certainly improve readers' vision, calculation and tactical memory banks." (<i>CHESS Magazine</i>)<br><br>"Erwich's book will help players of 1500-2000 Elo to discover and prepare tactical tricks. These will often decide the game immediately, but sometimes they will lead to an advantage that will need to be converted in the endgame." (B.H. Wilders <i>Nederlands Dagblad</i>)<br><br>"A well-thought out tactics book aimed at players rated from 1500-2000. One of the better exercise books to come out in recent years."

Who is behind the creation of value, and which types of people find value and comfort in transient, durable, and rubbish objects?<br> &nbsp;<br> When his highly influential <i>Rubbish Theory</i>, first published in 1979, Michael Thompson launched the discipline of waste studies. It remains the most comprehensive analysis on the culture of waste to date. Thompson argues that there are two mutually exclusive cultural categories that are socially imposed on the world of objects: a transient category and a durable category. However, he identifies a region of flexibility, wherein a transient object that declines in value and life span can linger in a valueless and timeless limbo of rubbish, until it is discovered by a creative individual and transferred into something deemed durable. He links stability and change on one hand, with materiality on the other, providing a rich analysis of social and cultural dynamics. His instrumental theory of rubbish draws on case studies and anthropological fieldwork to highlight the ever-changing subtleties of object value and our complex relationship to waste.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bringing <i>Rubbish Theory</i> back into print, this updated edition includes a new introduction, preface, foreword, and afterword, thoroughly exploring how Thompson&#x2019;s key theories have affected our world in the four decades since it was first published and placing it in a contemporary context that shines light on the continued relevance of the book today.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Michael Thompson</b> is a senior research scholar at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg, Austria.

In this third edition of <em>The Oxford Guide to Library</em> <em>Research</em>, Thomas Mann maps out an array not just of important databases and print sources, but of several specific search techniques that can be applied profitably in any area of research. From academic resources to government documents to manuscripts in archives to business Web sites, Mann shows readers how best to exploit controlled subject headings, explains why browsing library shelves is still important in an online age, demonstrates how citation searching and related record searching produce results far beyond keyword inquiries, and offers practical tips on making personal contacts with knowledgeable people. Against the trendy but mistaken assumption that "everything" can be found on the Internet, Mann shows the lasting value of physical libraries and the unexpected power of traditional search mechanisms, while also providing the best overview of the new capabilities of computer indexing.<br><br>Throughout the book Mann enlivens his advice with real-world examples derived from his experience of having helped thousands of researchers, with interests in all subjects areas, over a quarter century. Along the way he provides striking demonstrations and powerful arguments against those theorists who have mistakenly announced the demise of print.<br><br>Essential reading for students, scholars, professional researchers, and laypersons, <em>The Oxford Guide to Library Research</em> offers a rich, inclusive overview of the information field, one that can save researchers countless hours of frustration in the search for the best sources on their topics.</p><p><br><strong>Thomas Mann, Ph.D.</strong>, a former private investigator, is currently a Reference Librarian in the Main Reading Room of the Library of Congress.

Orgyan Chokyi (1675-1729) spent her life in Dolpo, the highest inhabited region of the Nepal Himalayas. Illiterate and expressly forbidden by her master to write her own life story, Orgyan Chokyi received divine inspiration, defied tradition, and composed one of the most engaging autobiographies of the Tibetan literary tradition.<br> The <em>Life of Orgyan Chokyi</em> is the oldest known autobiography authored by a Tibetan woman, and thus holds a critical place in both Tibetan and Buddhist literature. In it she tells of the sufferings of her youth, the struggle to escape menial labor and become a hermitess, her dreams and visionary experiences, her relationships with other nuns, the painstaking work of contemplative practice, and her hard-won social autonomy and high-mountain solitude. In process it develops a compelling vision of the relation between gender, the body, and suffering from a female Buddhist practitioner's perspective.<br> Part One of <em>Himalayan Hermitess</em> presents a religious history of Orgyan Chokyi's Himalayan world, the <em>Life of Orgyan Chokyi</em> as a work of literature, its portrayal of sorrow and joy, its perspectives on suffering and gender, as well as the diverse religious practices found throughout the work. Part Two offers a full translation of the <em>Life of Orgyan Chokyi</em>. Based almost entirely upon Tibetan documents never before translated, <em>Himalayan Hermitess</em> is an accessible introduction to Buddhism in the premodern Himalayas.<br></p><p><br><strong>Kurtis R.

This acclaimed, best-selling series is successful because it "integrates" all four language skills--listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Integrated Chinese helps you understand how the Chinese language works grammatically, and how to use Chinese in real life&#x2014;how to understand it on the street, speak it on the telephone, read it in the newspaper, or write it in a report. The materials within Integrated Chinese&#x2019;s set of textbooks, workbooks, character workbooks, and audio CDs are divided into sections of listening, speaking, reading and writing. Two types of exercises are used: traditional exercises (fill-in-the-blank, sentence completion, translation) to help learners build a solid grammatical foundation, and communication-oriented exercises (speaking drills, discussion topics, etc.) to prepare them to function in a Chinese language environment. Frequently, authentic materials written for native Chinese speakers and realia (newspaper clippings, signs, tickets, etc.) are used. Notes on language use and Chinese culture are found throughout the textbooks. Textbooks and workbooks are available in simplified or traditional characters.</p><p></p><h2>Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex</h2><p><p>Punctuated with remarkable case studies, this book explores extraordinary encounters between hermaphrodites--people born with "ambiguous" sexual anatomy--and the medical and scientific professionals who grappled with them. Alice Dreger focuses on events in France and Britain in the late nineteenth century, a moment of great tension for questions of sex roles. While feminists, homosexuals, and anthropological explorers openly questioned the natures and purposes of the two sexes, anatomical hermaphrodites suggested a deeper question: just how many human sexes are there? Ultimately hermaphrodites led doctors and scientists to another surprisingly difficult question: what is sex, really?</p><p><i>Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex</i> takes us inside the doctors' chambers to see how and why medical and scientific men constructed sex, gender, and sexuality as they did, and especially how the material conformation of hermaphroditic bodies--when combined with social exigencies--forced peculiar constructions. Throughout the book Dreger indicates how this history can help us to understand present-day conceptualizations of sex, gender, and sexuality. This leads to an epilogue, where the author discusses and questions the protocols employed today in the treatment of intersexuals (people born hermaphroditic). Given the history she has recounted, should these protocols be reconsidered and revised?</p><p>A meticulously researched account of a fascinating problem in the history of medicine, this book will compel the attention of historians, physicians, medical ethicists, intersexuals themselves, and anyone interested in the meanings and foundations of sexual identity.</p></p><p>Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of Sex takes us inside the doctors&#39; chambers to see how and why medical and scientific men construed sex, gender, and sexuality as they did, and especially how the material conformation of hermaphroditic bodies - when combined with social exigencies - forced peculiar constructions.

IM van de Oudeweetering has done a good job identifying and classifying instructive middlegame positions by theme. Club players rated between 1600-2200 will benefit from this book and master level players (2200 and up) are also likely to pick up some new ideas by carefully reviewing the material.

(Uwe Bekemann <i>German Correspondence Chess Federation</i>)<br><br>I think it's an excellent book, and while it's not systematic in a way that would turn it into a primer on positional play, there is no question but that this will improve the positional understanding of many club players. I'd highly recommend this to players rated around 1400 to 2100, and I think even master can (and will) learn something from this book as well.

(IM Gary Lane <i>Chess Moves Magazine</i>)<br><br>It is an excellent book when it comes to freshen up the arsenal of typical but also unusual positional themes. This book calls for collecting positional ideas just as you collect typical combinations. Normally in a game the positional ideas precede the combinations and that's why this middlegame book is so important.

Mura argues for a more inclusive and expansive definition of craft, particularly in relationship to race, even as he elucidates timeless rules of narrative construction in fiction and memoir. His essays offer technique-focused readings of writers such as James Baldwin, ZZ Packer, Maxine Hong Kingston, Mary Karr, and Garrett Hongo, while making compelling connections to Mura&#x2019;s own life and work as a Japanese American writer.</p><p>In <i>A Stranger&#x2019;s Journey</i>, Mura poses two central questions. The first involves identity: How is writing an exploration of who one is and one&#x2019;s place in the world? Mura examines how the myriad identities in our changing contemporary canon have led to new challenges regarding both craft and pedagogy. Here, like Toni Morrison&#x2019;s <i>Playing in the Dark</i> or Jeff Chang&#x2019;s <i>Who We Be</i>, <i>A Stranger&#x2019;s Journey</i> breaks new ground in our understanding of the relationship between the issues of race, literature, and culture.</p><p>The book&#x2019;s second central question involves structure: How does one tell a story? Mura provides clear, insightful narrative tools that any writer may use, taking in techniques from fiction, screenplays, playwriting, and myth. Through this process, Mura candidly explores the newly evolved aesthetic principles of memoir and how questions of identity occupy a central place in contemporary memoir.</p></p><p>How questions of identity occupy a central place in contemporary memoirDAVID MURA is a memoirist, novelist, poet, and literary critic.

This is because the rabbinic legal system has rarely wielded the political power to enforce its many detailed rules, nor has it ever been the law of any state. Even more idiosyncratically, the talmudic rabbis claim that the study of halakhah is a holy endeavor that brings a person closer to God&#x2015;a claim no country makes of its law.</p><p>In this panoramic book, Chaim Saiman traces how generations of rabbis have used concepts forged in talmudic disputation to do the work that other societies assign not only to philosophy, political theory, theology, and ethics but also to art, drama, and literature. In the multifaceted world of halakhah where everything is law, law is also everything, and even laws that serve no practical purpose can, when properly studied, provide surprising insights into timeless questions about the very nature of human existence.</p><p>What does it mean for legal analysis to connect humans to God? Can spiritual teachings remain meaningful and at the same time rigidly codified? Can a modern state be governed by such law? Guiding readers across two millennia of richly illuminating perspectives, this book shows how halakhah is not just &#x201c;law&#x201d; but an entire way of thinking, being, and knowing.</p></p><p><b>Chaim N.

He lives with his wife and three daughters in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.&#x201c;Chaim Saiman has written a genuinely enthralling book about a concept central to rabbinic Judaism: the study of Jewish law, not only as a guide to life but as ongoing encounter with the divine. A superb, much-needed, and enlightening work.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks </b><br><br>&#x201c;In the best halakhic tradition, this enlightening book informs the beginner by providing a concise introduction in a lucid and engaging style, yet also provokes the experienced halakhist to deep thought and self-reflection on the meaning and development of the halakhic system. Saiman expresses an undiminished youthful passion for his subject, distilled through the prism of mature legal scholarship.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Mosheh Lichtenstein, dean of Yeshivat Har Etzion, Israel</b><br><br>&#x201c;Saiman provides an academically sophisticated introduction to Jewish law as a historical and lived practice and proposes an original and even surprising thesis about the nature of rabbinic legal discourse&#x2015;that it is less about governance of conduct and more about the exploration of religious values and ideals. This is a terrific book.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Noah Feldman, Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law, Harvard University</b><br><br>&#x201c;In this pellucid and captivating book, Chaim Saiman provides a new understanding of halakhah that takes as axiomatic its seamless integration of regulatory and expressive modalities into a discourse that not only conveys legal norms but also shapes thought, communicates social and religious values, and explores enduring human questions. At stake is our very conception of what law is and could be.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Christine Hayes, author of<i> What&#x2019;s Divine about Divine Law?</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Saiman&#x2019;s book is a compelling and original exposition of the unique nature of halakhah as a legal system, providing both a larger picture of what halakhah is and brilliant particular readings of its diverse genres and periods. Saiman&#x2019;s vast erudition and conceptual depth shines through every page of this wonderful book.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Moshe Halbertal, author of <i>Maimonides: Life and Thought</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Halakhah</i> not only succeeds wonderfully as an introductory text but brims with ideas, formulations, interpretations, and perspectives that will stimulate, enrich, and catalyze scholars as well. Saiman&#x2019;s smart, comprehensive, and regularly brilliant book will stand as a significant contribution for some while to come.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Yehudah Mirsky, Brandeis University</b></p><h2>Teaching Children to Read: The Teacher Makes the Difference</h2><p>This is a loose leaf book.

He also reports on the way chickens are raised today and how they are consumed. What he discovers about America&#x2019;s favorite meat is not just unpleasant but a powerful indictment of our industrial food system. The process of bringing chicken to our dinner tables is unhealthy for all concerned&#x2014;from farmer to factory worker to consumer. The book traces the development of the poultry industry since the Second World War, analyzing the impact of such changes as the destruction of the family farm, the processing of chicken into nuggets and patties, and the changing makeup of the industrial labor force. The author describes the lives of immigrant workers and their reception in the small towns where they live. The conclusion is clear: there has to be a better way. Striffler proposes radical but practical change, a plan that promises more humane treatment of chickens, better food for the consumer, and fair payment for food workers and farmers.</p></p><p><p><b>Steve Striffler</b> is associate professor of anthropology, University of Arkansas.</p><p>"Like <i>Fast Food Nation</i>, <i>Chicken</i> will drop more than a few jaws with its descriptions, facts, and figures. That&#x2019;s all the better.

Striffler clearly takes sides in the book, but the righteous indignation and polemics don&#x2019;t overpower the scholar&#x2019;s comprehensive approach to the topic. His insight goes beyond the problems of chicken."&#x2014;Scott Carlson, <i>Baltimore City Paper</i></p><br><p>"Striffler is a gutsy academic willing to dirty his hands, an academic who . . . writes well. . . . <i>Chicken</i> ought to become a touchstone. . . .

It is oxygen. We inhale it every<br>day of our lives, and while it makes up only 21 percent of the air we breathe, it is<br>key to our very existence. The more we learn about its healing properties, the<br>more we recognize its tremendous potential as a medical treatment for many<br>serious disorders. Yet few have known about its important therapeutic uses&#x2015;until<br>now. In his new book, Anti-Inflammatory Oxygen Therapy, best-selling author Dr.<br>Mark Sircus examines the remarkable benefits oxygen therapy offers, from<br>detoxification to treatments for disorders such as arthritis and aging, with a<br>special emphasis on cancer.</p> <p>While the term &#x201c;oxygen therapy&#x201d; conjures images of a crucially ill patient lying in<br>a hospital bed with tubes strapped to his face, this book will show that oxygen<br>can offer so much more. Dr. Sircus first looks at the nature of oxygen and its<br>purpose in the body. He then provides an understanding of how inflammation<br>works to destroy the body&#x2019;s tissues over time, and how oxygen can reverse this<br>process. He examines the current treatments that use hyperbaric oxygen<br>chambers as well as newer protocols that employ this vital element. In addition,<br>Dr. Sircus offers a simple, safe, and highly effective fifteen-minute technique that<br>can be used in the privacy of your home so that you can enjoy maximum benefits<br>for a healthier life.</p> <p>If you are wondering why you haven&#x2019;t heard about this &#x201c;miracle&#x201d; treatment<br>before, the truth is that oxygen cannot be patented, it is not expensive, and you<br>don&#x2019;t have to be a specialist to use it. Without a tremendous profit behind it, it&#x2019;s<br>become a well-kept secret, but the facts speak for themselves. In this book, you<br>will learn these life-altering facts&#x2015;information that could change your health for<br>the better.</p></p><p><p><i>Mark Sircus, Ac., OMD, DM (P) </i>was trained in acupuncture and Oriental medicine at the Institute of Traditional Medicine in Santa Fe and the School of Traditional Medicine of New England in Boston. He also served at the Central Public Hospital of Pochutla, Mexico. He is part of the Scientific Advisory and Research Development team of the Da Vinci College of Holistic Medicine.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ambulance crews have often regarded oxygen as something approaching a wonder drug. Oxygen has always been a lifesaving treatment and now doctors and patients can do much more lifesaving because they will be able to give much more oxygen. What you are going to read in this book will have a strong impact on the future practice of medicine. What has been discovered is a new form of therapy that allows for unlimited oxygen to be administered safely. <strong><em>Anti-Inflammatory Oxygen Therapy</em></strong> introduces a new simple way of injecting massive amounts of oxygen into the cells. In fifteen minutes one can open the cells allowing them to detoxify as they gulp down higher levels of oxygen. What I have discovered will help many people pull out of chronic situations where they have not been able to do so before. </p> <p>Dr. Paul Harch&#x2019;s book, <em>The Oxygen Revolution</em>, details firsthand accounts of the healing and restorative effects of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy, commonly referred to as HBOT. The list of diseases and trauma that Dr. Harch contends can be treated with HBOT is extensive---so extensive that the reader could find themselves thinking that HBOT is being put forth as a panacea: good for whatever ails you. Though he is quick to point out the therapy is not a cure-all, in most of the cases he describes, there has been improvement in the patients&#x2019; conditions. <br><em></em></p> <p><strong><em>Anti-Inflammatory Oxygen Therapy</em></strong> does everything that HBOT does and more, much more. HBOT does not reach the threshold of oxygen where a broad, deep, and quick anti-inflammatory effect occurs. Anti-inflammatory Oxygen Therapy is like putting out a candle flame with your fingers. In the first 15 minute session (or let&#x2019;s say first four sessions) the inflammation in the capillaries will be snubbed and a layer of toxins will be cleared. Oxygen will rush into the cells bringing the energy and the physiological processes necessary to heal. It used to be called Oxygen Multi-Step Therapy or EWOT (Exercise with Oxygen Therapy), which would take as much as 32 hours to do what can be done in fifteen minutes. </p> <p>Oxygen Multi-Step Therapy was invented by Dr. Manfred von Ardenne of Germany. Dr. von Ardenne was probably Otto Warburg&#x2019;s prize student. Warburg received the 1931 Nobel Prize for proving that cancer can only grow in an oxygen-starved environment. Cancer is anaerobic. Dr. von Ardenne went on to do approximately 150 studies combining exercise with extra oxygen. Anti-Inflammatory Oxygen Therapy takes oxygen therapies to a new level with the use of a new simple invention that makes these older oxygen therapies much more effective. By improving delivery of the most important substance for tissue life and repair, the body will have a much better opportunity to correct any problem. Anti-inflammatory Oxygen Therapy is the most dramatic single thing you can do to prevent disease and restore health. Now we have the tools to turn back the aging clock in our circulation to youthful parameters in just a few weeks. </p> <p>Nothing comes close to the raw healing and detoxifying and alkalinizing power of oxygen. Oxygen is the answer to everything right and wrong with life and if one gets enough of it one can heal from just about anything.&nbsp; Anti-Inflammatory Oxygen Therapy is the process of avalanching down on the cells a massive amount of oxygen---in other words---a massive amount of healing life force. <em>The Oxygen Revolution</em> and Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in general only introduce what is possible with the higher oxygen levels that are made possible with Anti-Inflammatory Oxygen Therapy. </p> <p>Anti-Inflammatory Oxygen Therapy is a monumental breakthrough that can benefit nearly everyone and is easily administered in your own home. It will bring you back to the fountain of your own fully oxygenated youth so the anti-aging community will love this therapy as will athletes and sports trainers. Every clinic should have one as well as spas. One&#x2019;s first medical dollars need to be allocated for oxygen; for nothing will give you anywhere near the same bang for the buck as Anti-Inflammatory Oxygen Therapy. </p> <p>This book is designed to present a clear understanding of the healing properties of oxygen. In Part One you will be introduced to oxygen and its many roles in supporting and maintaining your body&#x2019;s vital functions. It takes a look at oxygen as a nutritional drug, as a therapeutic agent, and the miraculous healing properties of oxygen in chronic and acute patient care. In this section you will gain an understanding of how one develops low-oxygen levels and how oxygen deficiency has been linked to almost every major illness. You will also learn how inflammation works to destroy the body&#x2019;s tissues over time, and how oxygen, along with carbon dioxide, sodium bicarbonate, and magnesium can reverse this process. </p> <p>Part Two of the book sets the foundation for understanding proper breathing techniques which can be achieved through respiratory training and breathing devices to restore the body to optimum health. It examines how a lack of oxygen causes cells to age, and how oxygen treatments can effectively be used for anti-aging. This knowledge base will also allow you to see how oxygen-rich blood can improve your sex life by acting as a stress reliever, increasing circulation, and speeding up your metabolism.</p> <p>In Part Three, you will take a closer look at the way the medical community currently views and treats cancer. This section provides a better understanding of the causes of cancer&#x2015;and how it can be prevented. It examines the common triggers and key factors that cause inflammation&#x2015;and you will learn how cancer starts with inflammation. This section also lays out the research that shows that oxygen consumption is related to a decreased risk of cancer death,&nbsp; as well as lessening the chances of the occurrence of other diseases, such as Parkinson&#x2019;s, Alzheimer&#x2019;s, and cardiovascular disease. You will also learn why choosing rays for radiation and chemicals for chemotherapy are the wrong choices and that oxygen therapy itself is the ultimate chemotherapy. The last chapter in this section demonstrates how chronic inflammatory illnesses, when not treated correctly or left untreated, may lead to cancer. This chapter specifically deals with GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease)&#x2015;how low-oxygen conditions may lead to esophageal cancer, and how to potentially prevent it from ever developing. </p> <p>By the time you finish reading <strong><em>Anti-Inflammatory Oxygen Therapy</em></strong>, you will be equipped with the knowledge of how and why improving the delivery of the most important substance for tissue life and repair gives the body a much better opportunity to correct any health problem. Anti-Inflammatory Oxygen Therapy offers the world of oncology the most powerful way of injecting oxygen into the body for anyone still capable of getting on a stationary bicycle, treadmill, or jumper. Anti-inflammatory Oxygen Therapy is the most dramatic single thing you can do to prevent disease and restore well-being.</p></p><h2>The Rough Riders</h2><p>Expands and illustrates Theodore Roosevelt&#39;s classic account of his military exploits in the jungles of Cuba</p><p>6 1-hour cassettesIn 1898, as the Spanish-American War was escalating, Theodore Roosevelt assembled an improbable regiment of Ivy Leaguers, cowboys, Native Americans, African-Americans, and Western Territory land speculators. This group of men, which became known as the Rough Riders, trained for four weeks in the Texas desert and then set sail for Cuba. Over the course of the summer, Roosevelt's Rough Riders fought valiantly, and sometimes recklessly, in the Cuban foothills, incurring casualties at a far greater rate than the Spanish. <br>Roosevelt kept a detailed diary from the time he left Washington until his triumphant return from Cuba later that year. The Rough Riders was published to instant acclaim in 1899. Robust in its style and mesmerizing in its account of battle, it is exhilarating, illuminating, and utterly essential reading for every armchair historian and at-home general. <br>The books in the Modern Library War series have been chosen by series editor Caleb Carr according to the significance of their subject matter, their contribution to the field of military history, and their literary merit.</p><h2>Surviving Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: Hope, Treatment, and Recovery</h2><p>After her diagnosis of hormone-negative breast cancer, health journalist Patricia Prijatel did what any reporter would do: start investigating the disease, how it occurs, how it's treated, and how to keep it from recurring. While she learned that important research on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) was emerging, she found a noticeable lack of resources on the disease, which differs from hormone-positive breast cancer in important ways, including prognosis and treatment options. Triple-negative breast cancer disproportionately affects younger women and African-American women-and some forms of it can be more dangerous than other types of breast cancer. But there are many reasons to be hopeful, as Prijatel shows in this book. <br><br><em>Surviving Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</em> delivers research-based information on the biology of TNBC; the role of genetics, family history, and race; how to navigate treatment options; understanding a pathology report; and a plethora of strategies to reduce the risk of recurrence, including diet and lifestyle changes. In clear, approachable language, Prijatel provides a fact-filled guide based on a vast array of scientific studies. Woven throughout the book are stories of women who have faced TNBC. These are mothers, wives, daughters, and sisters who went through a variety of medical treatments and then got on with life--one competes in triathlons, two had babies after being treated with chemo, one got remarried in her 50s, and one just celebrated the 30th birthday of the son she was nursing when she was diagnosed. <br><br>Writing with honesty and humor, Prijatel delivers an inspiring message--that TNBC is a disease to take seriously, with proper and occasionally aggressive treatment, but it is not automatically a killer. Most women diagnosed with the disease survive and go on to live full lives. <em>Surviving</em> <em>Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</em> is a roadmap for women who want to be empowered through their treatment and recovery.<br><br></p><p><br><strong>Patricia Prijatel</strong>, E.T.

"Who is calling, please?"<br><br>I said in Yiddish, "A good week."<br><br>There was a slight pause. "Ah, a good week," she said. Her tone softened.<br><br>I said in English, "My name is Davita Dinn. I'm calling about your request for an English tutor."<br><br>In the background I heard children crying. Turning away from the phone, she shouted something in Yiddish, which I did not understand. Into the phone she said, "You have done this before, teach English?"<br><br>"Yes. But not to a European survivor."<br><br>"How old are you?"<br><br>"Nearly eighteen."<br><br>"Where do you live?"<br><br>I told her.<br><br>"We will come to you. Is it all right tomorrow at three?"<br><br>I was alone when they arrived. Answering the front door bell, I saw a stocky, plain-looking woman in her thirties, garbed in a dark-gray dress that reached to below her knees. The dress had a frilly high neck and long sleeves. Standing a little behind and to her right was a thin boy in his teens, wearing a white long-sleeved shirt, dark trousers, and a dark skullcap.<br><br>I said, "Hello."<br><br>The woman said, "I am Sarah Polit."<br><br>"Come in."<br><br>We went into the living room. The afternoon sun fell on the pale-blue carpeting and the brick fireplace and the large painting of flowers on the wall.<br><br>The woman and the boy sat on the sofa. I took the easy chair across from them. The woman turned to the boy and spoke to him in Yiddish.<br><br>The boy had been staring at the fireplace. Now he looked at me, cleared his throat, and said something in Yiddish in a shaky voice.<br><br>I said, "I'm sorry, I don't understand Yiddish."<br><br>Sarah Polit said with surprise, "You speak no Yiddish?"<br><br>"My parents raised me in English."<br><br>"Your parents are in America a long time?"<br><br>"My mother came in early 1920. My father's family has been here since the seventeenth century."<br><br>"The seventeenth century?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"What does your father do?"<br><br>"My father is dead."<br><br>"Ah, I am sorry."<br><br>The boy sat looking at the two of us. He had oval features: pallid skin across his cheekbones, a straight nose, a pointed chin. His hair was cut short and black, and his wide dark eyes darted from me to his aunt. I did not know how much of the conversation he understood.<br><br>Sarah Polit asked, "What did you say your name is?"<br><br>"Ilana Davita Dinn."<br><br>"Dinn is your father's name?"<br><br>"No, my stepfather's."<br><br>"What does your stepfather do?"<br><br>"He's an immigration lawyer."<br><br>She looked at my blond hair and blue eyes. "You observe the commandments?"<br><br>Her questions did not surprise me; she wanted to be sure about the kind of home to which she was entrusting the boy.<br><br>I told her that I observed the commandments.<br><br>"And you have taught English to people who have come from Europe?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>She was quiet.<br><br>I turned to the boy. "What's your name?"<br><br>The boy looked at his aunt.<br><br>"Tell her, Noah."<br><br>"I am call Noah Stremin."<br><br>"Where did you hear English?"<br><br>"American soldati after war."<br><br>Sarah Polit was looking closely at my blond hair and blue eyes. She asked, "What was your father? What did he do?"<br><br>"He was a journalist."<br><br>"What was his name?"<br><br>"Michael Chandal."<br><br>"You took your stepfather's name?"<br><br>"He gave me his name when he adopted me."<br><br>Sarah Polit sat back. I had the notion she had decided to ask no more questions. We were a religious family, and she was fortunate to have found us. Most teachers didn't want to work during the summer months; many took their families to bungalows in the country to get them away from the streets.<br><br>I asked, "Where in Europe are you from, Mrs. Polit?"<br><br>"I came in the twenties from a town called Kralov, not far from Cracow."<br><br>"I know about Cracow. About sixty thousand Jews."<br><br>"Well, Kralov had four thousand Jews, a Jewish market, small synagogues and schools, and a wooden synagogue. Both our families were from Kralov."<br><br>He was sitting next to her, looking at the carpet. His face without expression. It was not possible to tell if he understood what she was saying.<br><br>"There was a pogrom in Kralov in the late twenties, and my father sent me here to America. He, my mother, and my two brothers, they stayed. May their memories be for a blessing."<br><br>The boy raised his hands, turned them over, and looked at them. A grimace crossed his face. Putting his hands back on his knees, he sat staring at the fireplace.<br><br>Pronouncing the words with care, I asked him, "Noah, is there anything special you like to do?"<br><br>He raised his head and looked at me blankly.<br><br>"I thought we might start with words for something you enjoy doing."<br><br>Sarah Polit said, "He was three years in a slave labor camp and two years in a displaced persons camp. He just now arrived in America. He does not yet know what he likes."<br><br>"Can he come twice a week?"<br><br>"Twice a week. Yes."<br><br>"Sundays and Wednesdays."<br><br>"What do you charge?"<br><br>"Five dollars a lesson. We can start this Wednesday at three."<br><br>"What should he bring?"<br><br>"A notebook and a pencil."<br><br>"That's all?"<br><br>"For the time being."<br><br>"I thank you."<br><br>She spoke to the boy in Yiddish. He got off the sofa, and I saw him go through the entrance hallway to the front door. As he opened the door he gave me an over-the-shoulder look, and I felt his dark eyes on my face. He closed the door behind him.<br><br>Sarah Polit remained seated on the sofa, looking at the door. Then she turned to me.<br><br>"Noah is the only one who survived."<br><br>"The only one in his family? I am sorry."<br><br>"The only Jew in the town."<br><br>I felt cold to the bone.<br><br>"Four thousand Jews, and he is the only survivor. My husband and I, we say to ourselves God saved him for a reason."<br><br>I sat very still.<br><br>She rose from the sofa. "He knows, of course. He has terrible dreams." She looked around the room. "Tell me, is three o'clock the only time you have?"<br><br>"It's best for me."<br><br>She smoothed her dress. "He will be here on Wednesday, God willing. I thank you very much for your time."<br><br>She went out the door.<br><br>From the window of the living room I watched them walk along the street together in the hot shade of the early summer maple trees.</p><h2>Through a Window - My Thirty Years With the Chimpanzees of Gombe</h2><p>The dramatic saga of 30 years in the life of Gombe, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, where the principle residents are chimpanzees and one extraordinary woman.

Gospel-Centered Counseling equips readers to change lives with Christ&#x2019;s changeless truth. It does so by examining life&#x2019;s seven ultimate questions and then guiding readers on a journey that explores the biblical, gospel-centered narrative of:</p><ul><li>The Word: &#x201c;What is truth?&#x201d; &#x201c;Where can I find answers?&#x201d;</li><li>The Trinity: &#x201c;Who is God?&#x201d; &#x201c;Can I know Him personally?&#x201d;</li><li>Creation: &#x201c;Who am I?&#x201d; &#x201c;What makes people tick?&#x201d;</li><li>Fall: &#x201c;What went wrong?&#x201d; &#x201c;Why do we do the things we do?&#x201d;</li><li>Redemption: &#x201c;Can I change?&#x201d; &#x201c;How do people change?&#x201d;</li><li>Glorification: &#x201c;Where am I headed?&#x201d; &#x201c;How does our future destiny impact our present reality?&#x201d;</li><li>Sanctification: &#x201c;How can I help?&#x201d; &#x201c;How can I change lives?"</li></ul><p>Bob Kellemen builds on the foundation of the written Word and provides a gospel-centered resource for understanding people, diagnosing problems, and prescribing biblically-based solutions.</p><p>Gospel-Centered Counseling is the first volume in The Equipping Christian Counselors Series, a comprehensive relational training curriculum for the local church that provides a model for equipping God&#x2019;s people to change lives with Christ&#x2019;s changeless truth.

Bob frames every counseling issue within the drama of redemption and in the hope of the gospel. The result? A book that belongs on every pastor&#x2019;s shelf! It is wise, filled with exegetical insights that flower into rich, everyday counsel. It is deep, addressing the whole person, mind, body, and spirit. It is broad, deftly moving from Scripture, into the soul, and back out into real life with wonderful clarity. It is compassionate. I felt loved and understood by Bob, the sign of a good counselor. Most of all, it is true, imparting the hope of Christ into the heart of people --- &#x201c;Behold, I am making all things new!&#x201d; -- Jonathan K. Dodson, Lead Pastor City Life Church, Author of Gospel-Centered Discipleship<br><br>As I read through Gospel-Centered Counseling, I kept finding myself responding to the words I was reading . . . and that response was vocal. I was amazed. Blessed. Enlightened. Encouraged. Reminded. Bob Kellemen understands grace and the gospel in ways that are profound, beautiful, and astonishing. I love this book and the gospel that is so beautifully portrayed here where the rubber meets the road, in our daily lives, in our struggle to believe and to live in the light of all he&#x2019;s done. What a blessing! -- Elyse Fitzpatrick, Author of Good News for Weary Women and Give Them Grace<br><br>Gospel-Centered Counseling is more than a book on how to counsel others. It is a clear and compelling presentation of how the gospel changes everything. Bob has weaved the grand narrative of Scripture with practical application for everyday life. He has called us to be wise counselors who care about orthodoxy while bringing the Word to hurting people with love and care in such a way that grace is not compromised on the road to truth. I would recommend this book first for your personal edification and second as a guide to helping others grow and change. -- Garrett Higbee, Executive Director of Biblical Soul Care, Harvest Bible Chapel<br><br>Insightful and practical, Dr. Kellemen&#x2019;s Gospel-Centered Counseling provides a comprehensive guide for leading readers deep into the contours of genuine biblical soul care. His ability to effectively apply rich gospel-saturated theology to the here-and-now struggles of the human soul is impressive. This is an excellent read for anyone wanting to enhance their understanding of Scripture and how it applies to the complexities of the human estate. -- Jeremy Lelek, Ph.D., LPC-S, President, Association of Biblical Counselors<br><br>Bob&#x2019;s heart for other people to know and understand the true heart behind biblical counseling is clearly articulated in this book. With so many competing voices and ideas as to where life change and healing come from, Bob has captured the heart and essence of the grand narrative of grace and redemption with this work. Gospel-Centered Counseling challenges the professional minister, pastor, counselor, and lay person to remember what they have been saved from and what they have been saved to through the gospel. This book encourages me as it can be so easy, as a minister of the gospel, to forget what should propel our work in the ministry. -- Lee Lewis, Biblical Counselor, Council Board Member, Biblical Counseling Coalition<br><br>Gospel-Centered Counseling is like a smartphone. That is, it can be helpful in multiple ways. Beginning biblical counselors will benefit from the case studies, which model how to minister the Word rather than just dispensing it. Experienced counselors will be prompted to evaluate whether or not their counseling truly reflects the major themes of the Scripture with appropriate application to the problems of life and living. Leaders seeking to disciple others will find in Gospel-Centered Counseling a book that teaches theology in a warm, equipping-for-life fashion. Preachers will find seeds of helpful sermon series. Every reader will be more thankful for Christ and the good news of the gospel. -- Randy Patten, Director of Training and Advancement, Association of Certified Biblical Counselors<br><br>What a gift Bob Kellemen is to the church today! Bob has been in the counseling trenches for three decades now, and in Gospel-Centered Counseling he weaves together a practical approach to helping real people with real problems. He never forgets that these are people who are suffering and don&#x2019;t just need counsel, they need compassion. The compassion at the heart of his counsel is rooted in a verse he weaves through the counseling process, showing us what it would look like to apply 1 Thessalo nians 2:8, which says, &#x201c;We loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our own lives as well, because you had become so dear to us.&#x201d; Get this book if you love God, love people, and really want to help. -- Brad Bigney, Sr. Pastor, Grace Fellowship Church, author of Gospel Treason<br><br>Gospel-Centered Counseling comprehensively applies our theology to our counseling--- it&#x2019;s a theology for life. It will be a vital resource for those who want to be equipped to use God&#x2019;s Word to help people in community. The extensive use of cases makes the book easy and enjoyable to read while also showing how key principles work in practical, real-life situations. The frequent &#x201c;tweetsize&#x201d; summaries are helpful and memorable. They also keep the reader on track with the book&#x2019;s main message: the gospel of grace is the foundation for change. Theology matters. -- Jim Newheiser, Executive Director, Institute for Biblical Counseling and Discipleship<br><br>Gospel-Centered Counseling is a book that ought to be in every biblical counselor&#x2019;s library. Bob Kellemen has dedicated his life to thinking deeply about the way the Good News of Jesus Christ intersects all of life and ministry. Bob writes as both a careful theologian and a compassionate counselor. His love for Jesus coupled with careful scholarship will help readers gain a greater understanding of the grand story of redemption. This book will change you for the better and equip you to help others in that same marvelous process. These are exciting days for the biblical counseling movement because there are more great resources than ever before. This book is more evidence that Jesus is carefully building his church. To him be the glory. -- Steve Viars, Sr. Pastor, Faith Church, author of Putting Your Past in its Place<br><br>The Scriptures were never intended to be a weekend medication to dull the pain of the weekly real-life questions that confuse, burden, depress, and weaken us. Rather, God gave us the Scriptures to provide daily practical discernment and nourishment, centered in the cross, that enables us to treat deadly diseases originating from unbiblical worldviews. Sounds fine for the professionals, but how does an ordinary nonprofessional answer life&#x2019;s most critical questions for himself and others? Dr. Kellemen in Gospel-Centered Counseling provides a seven-days-a-week cohesive perspective of Christian living and heart transformation that will help you and those you counsel to experience healthy heart transformation. Written in a style that combines stories, theology, and practical application, Gospel-Centered Counseling keeps you engaged!

The case rests on a remarkable compilation of examples of convergent evolution, in which two or more lineages have independently evolved similar structures and functions. The examples range from the aerodynamics of hovering moths and hummingbirds to the use of silk by spiders and some insects to capture prey. Going against the grain of Darwinian orthodoxy, this book is a must read for anyone grappling with the meaning of evolution and our place in the Universe. Simon Conway Morris is the Ad Hominen Professor in the Earth Science Department at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of St. John&#39;s College and the Royal Society. His research focuses on the study of constraints on evolution, and the historical processes that lead to the emergence of complexity, especially with respect to the construction of the major animal body parts in the Cambrian explosion. Previous books include The Crucible of Creation (Getty Center for Education in the Arts, 1999) and co-author of Solnhofen (Cambridge, 1990). Hb ISBN (2003) 0-521-82704-3</p><p>In a crisp, passionate argument sure to draw the wrath of many biologists, Simon Conway Morris defends his belief that evolutionary science is misguided without a somewhat religious notion of the significance of human intelligence and existence. At the same time, he is careful to distance himself from creation "scientists" by reminding readers that: <p> </p><blockquote>Evolution is true, it happens, it is the way the world is, and we too are one of its products. This does not mean that evolution does not have metaphysical implications; I remain convinced that this is the case.</blockquote> <p> He uses convergence as his foundation, defining it as "the recurrent tendency of biological organization to arrive at the same 'solution' to a particular 'need'" and offering a multitude of examples, including eusociality, olfaction, and the generation of electrical fields. In outlining the direction and inevitability he believes is inherent in evolution, Conway Morris stacks up compelling evidence in the form of a revealed "protein hyperspace" that limits the possibilities of amino acid combination to a few, often repeated (pre-ordained?) forms. While he skirts a focus on the relentless environmental pressures that result in adaptation, Conway Morris also derides the notion that the gene rules evolution. He accuses his opponents (primarily Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Dawkins) "genetic fundamentalism" who use "sleights of hand, special pleading, and sanctimoniousness... trying to smuggle back the moral principle through the agency of the gene." Dense with examples and complex biological proofs, <i>Life's Solution</i> is not an easy explanation of convergence for general readers. Still, it is a clear and exciting elucidation of the theory that evolution might have predictable outcomes, even for those who find Conway Morris' metaphysical arguments unconvincing. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>Re-run the tape of life, and sit back to enjoy a myriad of new and bizarre life forms, unrecognisable to any inhabitant of today&#39;s Earth. Or could we? The eminent evolutionary palaeobiologist Simon Conway Morris sets out to challenge the widely accepted view that biological organisms are the result of evolutionary accident. He explores evidence indicating that life is in fact constrained and that a re-run would result in a different, but eerily familiar world. This extraordinarily wide-ranging book will be of great interest to general readers and specialists alike.</p><h2>Applied Management Science: Modeling, Spreadsheet Analysis, and Communication for Decision Making, 2nd Edition</h2><p><p>Appropriate for a one semester Soph/Jr/Sr/MBA level course in Management Science, Quantitative Methods for Business, or Operations Research.

Once arrested, he is released, but must report to court on a regular basis--an event that proves maddening, as nothing is ever resolved. As he grows more uncertain of his fate, his personal life--including work at a bank and his relations with his landlady and a young woman who lives next door--becomes increasingly unpredictable.

BOMC Main.</p><p>Since The Eagle Has Landed&#x2015;one of the biggest-selling thrillers of all time&#x2015;every novel Jack Higgins has written has become an international bestseller. He has had simultaneous number-one bestsellers in hardcover and paperback, and many of his books have been made into successful movies, including The Eagle Has Landed, To Catch a King, On Dangerous Ground, Eye of the Storm, and Thunder Point. He has degrees in sociology, social psychology, and economics from the University of London, and a doctorate in media from Leeds Metropolitan University. A fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, and an expert scuba diver and marksman, Higgins lives in Jersey on the Channel Islands.An old-fashioned framing device kicks off this rerelease: The author and his wife survive a rough plane ride on a stormy night. While recovering in a small inn, they hear a WWII yarn -- the tale of twin American brothers who fought for opposite sides in the war and the plan concocted by desperate Germans to take advantage of their resemblance. The switching of twins is a classic theme, but the skills of both author Jack Higgins and narrator Patrick Macnee keep the tale fresh and entertaining. Higgins's skill in recreating the war era makes this one worth catching up on. J.A.S. � AudioFile 2002, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Listening to Western Music (with Download, 1 term (6 months) Printed Access Card)</h2><p>LISTENING TO WESTERN MUSIC equips you with the tools to actively listen to and inspire a lifelong appreciation for music. Known for his clear, conversational style, Professor Wright helps you immediately find connections to music by comparing pop and classical music concepts. His text is organized chronologically and discusses musical examples from each era in its social context -- describing the construction and culture of each piece. LISTENING TO WESTERN MUSIC is fully integrated with MindTap to better help you develop your listening skills and maximize your course success. Online resources include interactive exercises, streaming music, Active Listening Guides, chapter and critical thinking quizzes, iAudio lectures, YouTube videos, Beat the Clock games, and more. You also can download all music directly to a music library.</p><p>Craig M. Wright received his Bachelor of Music degree at the Eastman School of Music in 1966 and his Ph.D. in musicology from Harvard University in 1972. He began his teaching career at the University of Kentucky and for the past forty years has been teaching at Yale University, where he is currently the Henry L. and Lucy G. Moses Professor of Music. At Yale, Wright&#39;s courses include his perennially popular introductory course, Listening to Music (also part of the offerings of Open Yale Courses); his large lecture course Exploring the Nature of Genius; and most recently his Coursera course Introduction to Classical Music. He is the author of numerous scholarly books and articles on composers ranging from Leoninus to Bach. Wright has also been the recipient of many awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Einstein and Kinkeldey Awards of the American Musicological Society, and the Dent Medal of the International Musicological Society. In 2004, he was awarded the honorary degree Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Chicago. And in 2010 he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, joining fellow inductee, banjo player Steve Martin. In addition to LISTENING TO MUSIC and LISTENING TO WESTERN MUSIC, EIGHTH EDITION, Wright has also published THE ESSENTIAL LISTENING TO MUSIC, SECOND EDITION; LISTENING TO MUSIC, CHINESE EDITION (Schirmer Cengage Learning/Three Union Press, 2012), translated and simplified by Profs. Li Xiujung (China Conservatory, Beijing) and Yu Zhigang (Central Conservatory, Beijing), both of whom worked with Wright at Yale; and MUSIC IN WESTERN CIVILIZATION, MEDIA UPDATE (Schirmer Cengage Learning, 2010), with coauthor Bryan Simms. He is currently at work on a volume titled MOZART&#39;S BRAIN: EXPLORING THE NATURE OF GENIUS.Its strengths are its 1) readability for a general audience 2) wonderful online resources ... 3) conciseness in terms of the material it presents 4) its provision of an eBook as well as a hard copy version of the text, and, 5) use of music samples by current artists who may be more familiar to students.<br><br>The writing is very clear and an "enjoyable read". He gives pertinent information and keeps the reader engaged without boredom or using a "dumbing down" approach. It is written in such a way as to keep the reader personally engaged and spurred to actively listen to music, and not just as a list of musical history. I especially like the references to popular culture and feel they help the reader make relevant connections from historical and factual information to recent and current trends in music. The Checklists of Musical Style are also particularly useful and help students to summarize the information presented for each era. The "What to Listen For" pointers are good and direct the readers/listeners to the main aspects to be discovered in each piece. This is an excellent, thorough text for today's college student and should increase student interest and understanding of the topics presented. It will spur students to explore music outside of the classroom and teach them to actively listen to music.<br><br>Great survey with terrific supporting materials, including maps, graphs in different colors, good timelines. Good selection of materials: representative and thorough. Textual language is college level but clear. First chapter especially well done. Great references to pop culture. Introduction to modern issues about music is very thoughtfully presented. Where are we going? Loved the musical styles checklist. The modern student could feel at home with the many selections of "how to listen" to the materials. This is a great book for a college population who actually read the text. It covers each period in around 80 pages, but it is approachable for the student of today who wants materials in many formats. Great supporting materials like maps, graphs and art works.</p><h2>Introduction to Logic: Predicate Logic</h2><p><p><b></b> This clearly written book makes logic interesting and easier to learn without sacrificing content or rigor. <b></b> It covers symbolization, proofs, counterexamples, and truth trees. These topics are presented in graded steps, beginning with the symbolization of categorical propositions and concluding with the properties of relations. Logic is applied to materials with which readers will be familiar; both examples and exercises are drawn from newspapers, television, and other popular sources. <b></b> For individuals intrigued by the formal study of logic. </p></p><p><p> This clearly written, new edition by <b>Howard Pospesel</b> extends to general statements the system developed in <i>Propositional Logic,</i> revised Third Edition. This new edition covers symbolization, proofs, counterexamples, and truth trees. These topics are presented in graded steps, beginning with the symbolization of categorical propositions and concluding with the properties of relations. </p> <p> Examples and exercises are drawn from such sources as newspapers, television broadcasts, films, books, and exams. The book enhances students' ability to recognize and evaluate the predicate arguments they encounter outside the logic classroom. Logic is made accessible without sacrificing rigor. </p> <b>Among the new and revised elements in the Second Edition:</b> <ul> <li>Many new exercises and examples</li> <li>A chapter on truth trees</li> <li>New sections treating possible-world counterexamples, intensional contexts, quantifier scope, and quantifier order</li> <li>An appendix on metatheory by William G. Lycan</li> </ul> <b>Also, with this new Second Edition!</b> <p> <i>PredLogic,</i> Windows-based software provides an environment in which students symbolize sentences, construct proofs of validity, devise counterexamples, and create truth trees. The program enables students to catch errors as they are made, and it offers hints for solving problems. </p><p><b> <i>Student's Preface</i> </b></p> <p> I have three aims for this book. The <i>first</i> goal is to teach you the vocabulary and grammar of predicate logic so that you will be able to translate the sentences of English (or other natural languages) into the notation of this important branch of symbolic logic. The <i>second</i> goal concerns three techniques for evaluating predicate arguments: formal proofs, counterexamples, and truth trees. I aim to help you become proficient in employing these logical methods. The <i>third</i> goal of the book is to develop your ability to identify and assess those predicate arguments you encounter daily as you read books and newspapers, carry on conversations, and watch television. Most of the examples and exercises in the text involve arguments of this everyday variety. </p> <p> I enjoyed writing the book. If you enjoy studying it (as I hope you will), I think my goals will be achieved. </p> <p> <i>Howard Pospesel<br> University of Miami</i> </p> <p><b> <i>Teacher's Preface</i> </b></p> <p> This text presupposes familiarity with propositional logic and, in particular, acquaintance with the natural-deduction approach to formal proofs and the technique of two-sided truth trees. Appendix One contains a review of this material, but it is too compact to be fully intelligible to the complete novice. A discussion of these techniques is provided in the companion volume, <i>Introduction to Logic: Propositional Logic,</i> revised third edition. </p> <p> Predicate logic is developed gradually in this book, starting with the simplest monadic symbolizations and proceeding through multiple quantification to the logic of relations. Students learn to symbolize <i>and</i> evaluate arguments of a given degree of complexity before addressing the symbolization of more complex problems. </p> <p> The formal-proof. system presented here does not include a universal-quantifier introduction rule. The advantages of this approach are that the quantifier rules can be stated more simply and that proofs (although often longer) are often easier to devise. A universal-quantifier introduction rule is provided in a footnote at the start of section 4.2 to accommodate students of teachers who prefer to include this rule. </p> <p> Most of the examples and exercises center around arguments similar to those encountered by students. The majority of these arguments are <i>natural,</i> rather than contrived; many are presented by direct quotation from newspapers and other sources. My purposes in employing natural everyday arguments are (1) to evoke the reader's interest, (2) to counter the common but mistaken view that formal logic is just an impractical academic diversion, and (3) to improve students' capacity to notice and assess the arguments they encounter. The final chapter explicitly addresses the problems that arise when predicate logic is applied to natural arguments. </p> <p> The second edition has been extensively revised. It differs from the first edition mainly in these ways: </p> <ul> <li>The book has been reorganized to allow students to develop symbolization and proof-construction skills even more gradually.</li> <li>There is a chapter on two-sided truth trees. Some instructors prefer to teach one-sided trees; a chapter explaining that technique is included on the CD-ROM disk packaged with the book.</li> <li>New sections treat possible-world counterexamples, intensional contexts, quantifier scope, and quantifier order.</li> <li>There are more exercises, and most of the original exercises and examples have been replaced by better and more current ones.</li> <li>The book is accompanied by a tutorial program, "PredLogic," written by Mark Pospesel and me. This Windows-based software provides an environment in which students symbolize sentences, construct proofs of validity, devise counterexamples, and create truth trees. The program enables students to catch errors as they are made, and it offers hints for solving problems.</li> <li>William G. Lycan has provided an appendix on the metatheory of predicate logic.</li> <li>This edition uses parenthesis-free quantifier symbols. These symbols have become standard since the first edition was published, and they are more suitable for doing logic on a computer. Gender-neutral language is used throughout. The chapter on logic diagrams (that appeared in the first edition) has been moved to the CD-ROM disk that accompanies the book.</li> </ul></p><h2>A History of US: Book 5: Liberty for All?

But the safety net that once protected us is fast unraveling. With retirement plans in growing jeopardy while health coverage erodes, more and more economic risk is shifting from government and business onto the fragile shoulders of the American family.<br><br>In <em>The Great Risk Shift</em>, Jacob S. Hacker lays bare this unsettling new economic climate, showing how it has come about, what it is doing to our families, and how we can fight back. Behind this shift, he contends, is the Personal Responsibility Crusade, eagerly embraced by corporate leaders and Republican politicians who speak of a nirvana of economic empowerment, an "ownership society" in which Americans are free to choose. But as Hacker reveals, the result has been quite different: a harsh new world of economic insecurity, in which far too many Americans are free to lose.<br><br>The book documents how two great pillars of economic security--the family and the workplace--guarantee far less financial stability than they once did. The final leg of economic support--the public and private benefits that workers and families get when economic disaster strikes--has dangerously eroded as political leaders and corporations increasingly cut back protections of our health care, our income security, and our retirement pensions. <br><br>Blending powerful human stories, big-picture analysis, and compelling ideas for reform, this remarkable volume will hit a nerve, serving as a rallying point in the vital struggle for economic security in an increasingly uncertain world.</p><p>In <i>The Great Risk Shift</i>, Jacob S.

But have you stopped to think about why? Why are our personal finances so much more anxiety-producing today? The stories in the headlines are all about the financial crisis at the very top--among the big banks and Wall Street firms, the hedge funds and financial insurers--but the story I tell in <em>The Great Risk Shift</em> is about the slow-moving financial crisis that has crept into the lives of the rest of us as risk has moved from the broad shoulders of government and corporations onto the backs of American workers and their families.</p> <p>Our jobs, our health care, our family finances, and our pension plans are all less secure--and the reason is pretty much the same across all these areas. We've seen major changes in our economy, yet little response from our corporate and political leaders. Indeed, the big response is--you guessed it--to shift more risk onto us. So guaranteed pension plans morph into risky 401(k) plans, traditional health plans morph into Health Savings Accounts--or no pension plan or health plan at all. Meanwhile, proponents of the risk shift call for partial privatization of Social Security and shifting away from employment-based health insurance to individually purchased, unregulated plans--all to put more of your skin in the game.</p> <p>Make no mistake. Your skin is very much in the game already, and each of us has to step up to the challenge on our own and together. Acting alone, we can set up a sunny-day fund to put aside unexpected windfalls (rare as they sometimes seem) for future rainy days. We can also check out our private and public insurance options using the guidelines in the book. And with simple mortgages and pre-set savings, we can commit ourselves to do automatically what we have trouble doing optionally.</p> <p>But I wouldn't feel the book was complete if it just said, "It's up to you," because, frankly, there's no way most of us can deal with these risks on our own. We need to "get mad" and then "get even," as I put it in the book, to put in place a new set of priorities. So read the book for a simple (I promise) health plan that can cover everyone, and which was the basis for leading candidates' plans in this year's presidential race. I will tell you how 401(k)'s can be truly made secure and predictable (really!) and how we can deal with the job insecurity that plagues so many.</p> <p><em>The Great Risk Shift</em> is an expose, a call to arms, and handbook for how we can get back to the basic idea that once made our middle-class strong: people who work hard and do right by their families should have a basic foundation of financial security to be able to confidently reach for the American Dream. I promise the book will change the way you look at your own financial situation and our nation&#x2019;s choices. Please check the book out for yourself.</p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>Jacob S. Hacker<br></p>"<i>The Great Risk Shift</i> is a powerful and timely account of the forces driving the ascendance of economic insecurity in America. But Hacker does more than describe the problem; he offers a thoughtful and ambitious policy agenda and explains how each of us can make our own families more secure. This is an important book for anyone concerned about the continuing vitality of the American dream." -- John Edwards, former U.S. Senator and Director, Center on Poverty, Work, and Opportunity at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill <p>"What Hacker so effectively documents in the <i>The Great Risk Shift</i> is that for too many Americans, Washington's pursuit of a so-called Ownership Society has instead brought about deepening economic insecurity. From job tenure and health coverage to retirement planning, corporations and governments are offloading longstanding institutional responsibilities onto the fragile psychologies and balance sheets of ordinary families and households. Small wonder the public doesn't trust the national economy and its circumstances." -- Kevin Phillips, author of <i>American Theocracy</i> </p><p>"America's largest social class isn't upper-income, middle, or poor. It's our sprawling anxious class. As Jacob Hacker shows in this lucid and riveting account, American families are experiencing more and more uncertainty about their future, and the reigning conservative orthodoxy is exposing them to ever greater risk. Hacker lifts up the floor boards of conservative's much touted "ownership society" and reveals the extended rot. But he also offers up a new foundation for economic security. This is an important book." -- Robert B. Reich, Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley, and former U.S. Secretary of Labor </p><p>"Hacker shows that the decline in economic security is the major economic issue of our time, far more important than the occasional recessions and blips in the unemployment rate that preoccupy so many economists. This book powerfully illuminates the real scope of the problem." -- Robert J.

John Welwood's latest book addresses this question with new comprehensiveness and depth, building on the innovative psychospiritual approach of his six previous books. The questions he addresses include: <br> What can the spiritual methodologies of the East teach us about psychological health? What issues arise when the recognition of our larger nature challenges our very conception of individual self? What new directions become possible when psychological work is undertaken in a spiritual context? How does Western psychological understanding affect our approach to spirituality? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welwood's psychology of awakening brings together three major dimensions of human existence: personal, interpersonal, and suprapersonal, in one overall framework of understanding and practice. The book's first section addresses basic questions about the relationship between psychology and contemplative spirituality. The second explores the practical implications of this convergence for psychological health and healing. The third considers the implications for relationship and community.</p><p>Have you ever noticed that self-described spiritual people are not necessarily all that easy to be with? John Welwood has a term for what often happens--spiritual bypassing. This is when a person reaches for the stars while forgetting about the goop on his shoes. Welwood, author of the popular <i>Love and Awakening</i> and <i>Journey of the Heart</i> has made a profession out of bringing East and West together, integrating the path to enlightenment with the techniques of psychotherapy. In <i>Toward a Psychology of Awakening</i>, Welwood integrates a series of his articles written over a period of 30 years in an attempt to explain the dynamics of psychologies East and West. The hope is that, combined, they can create a wholeness that encompasses the various levels of human experience. Since many of these articles were written for specialist readers, they won't have the verve and inspiration of Welwood's other books, but Welwood fans and enthusiasts of transpersonal psychology will be delighted to have all these ground-breaking articles together in one place.

"The Raven" and "The Tell-Tale Heart" have been read as signs of his personal obsessions, and "The Fall of the House of Usher" and "The Descent into the Maelstrom" as symptoms of his own mental collapse. Biographers have seldom resisted the opportunities to confuse the pathologies in the stories with the events in Poe's life. Against this tide of fancy, guesses, and amateur psychologizing, Arthur Hobson Quinn's biography devotes itself meticulously to facts.

Lewis lacks a bibliography of works by and about that author. Wellman also fails to discuss the continuing importance and influence of either man. These flaws, however, pale in comparison to the convoluted writing that's full of phony, invented dialogue-and, in Bunyan, completely fabricated scenes. Few readers will plod through these tedious, unreliable pages. Beatrice Gormley's C. S. Lewis (Eerdmans, 1997) is a far superior and more attractive production.<br><i>Ann W.

It pulls out the portions of the building code that are most relevant for the architect and provides an easy-to-understand interpretation in both words and illustrations. Rather than a text-heavy book, this is much more conducive to quick comprehension of the code, presenting information in an exciting user-friendly visual format.</p></p><p><p><b>Five Trends in the 2012 International Building Code covered in the 4th Edition of <em>Building Codes Illustrated</em> by Steven R Winkel </b></p> <p> The new 4th edition of <em>Building Codes Illustrated</em> is aimed at two audiences. The first is students and emerging professionals who are just learning to use the building code. The second audience is more experienced practitioners looking to validate their interpretations of code sections and to familiarize themselves with changes made in the new 2012 <em>International Building Code</em>. The new 4th edition of <em>Building Codes Illustrated</em> uses graphics, the language of designers, to elaborate on the book&#x2019;s text to clarify code intent and requirements for code users. Below are trends I noticed while revising the 4th Edition text to accompany the wonderful illustrations of Francis D.K. Ching. These are just a few examples of the many changes to be found in the new code. </p> <p> </p><ol> <li> One trend in code revisions today is to make changes to &#x201c;clarify&#x201d; the code. These changes often involve not only rewording sections, but reorganizing the order of various sections. Section number changes make it very hard to find items based on remembering section numbers from old codes. In my code consulting practice I advise designers to never do code work from memory. While the code text indicates in the margins where sections have been deleted, it gives no guidance about whether the section has just been moved, or wholly deleted. This book gives guidance for such changes. </li> <li> Outpatient medical care occurs increasingly in facilities not located in traditional health-care centers. It is becoming common to find outpatient surgical procedures happening in tenant spaces. New requirements in Section 422 address fire separations of these medical spaces from adjacent tenants where the patients may be rendered unconscious or unable to move readily in an emergency. Examples of facilities that could be covered by these provisions are laser vision clinics and kidney dialysis treatment centers. </li> <li> The code requirements for fire protection of overhangs located close to a property line have always been confusing. There are revised code provisions for how to measure and protect overhangs that are accompanied by new illustrations in our book. </li> <li> Open &#x201c;exit&#x201d; stairs were relocated in the Mean of Egress Chapter, IBC Chapter 10, from the Exit section in Section 1022 to be &#x201c;exit access stairs&#x201d; in Section 1016 in the 2009 <em>International Building Code</em>, as illustrated in the 3rd Edition of our book. This revision was revised yet again in the 2012 code into requirements for open and enclosed stairs in Section 1009, as illustrated in the 4th Edition. </li> <li> Guard rail heights in R-3 occupancies and inside R-2 occupancies have been reduced in an Exception to Section 1013.3 to 36 inches from the 42 inch height previously required. This aligns the IBC with the <em>International Residential Code</em> requirements for one and two family dwellings. </li> </ol> <p></p> <p> There are numerous other changes described and illustrated in the new 4th edition of <em>Building Codes Illustrated</em>. </p><p><b>The easy-to-use, illustrated guide to the 2012 edition of the International Building Code�</b></p> <p>The <i>Fourth Edition</i> of this practical, user-friendly guide is fully updated and revised to reflect the 2012 International Building Code� (IBC). Marrying the graphic skills of bestselling author Francis D.K. Ching with the code expertise of Steven R. Winkel, <i>Building Codes Illustrated, Fourth Edition</i> features nearly 900 illustrations and easy-to-understand explanations of the portions of the building code that are most relevant for designers.</p> <p>Organized to correspond with the 2012 IBC, this edition allows readers to quickly navigate and access the latest codes for all types of construction, occupancy, usage, and modifications. It highlights the major changes between the current and previous building codes, helping architects understand how the introduction of the new 2012 IBC is going to affect their practice. Clear, precise interpretation of the fundamentals helps ensure that projects are up to code and free of costly mistakes.</p> <p><b>Praise for the 2009 edition:</b></p> <p>"<i>Building Codes Illustrated</i> is an accessible and trusted interpretive guide to the 2009 International Building Code� for architects, builders, engineers, and interior designers.

This catechism<i> </i>includes 345 Questions &amp; Answers, with practical applications&#x2015;all in simple modern English. Each section begins with an explanation especially intended for those with no prior knowledge of Christianity. This superb special edition features bonded leather, gold foil cover, gilt-edge pages, ribbon bookmark, a presentation page, and an Introduction by the eminent theologian JI Packer.</p> <p>In the early church converts underwent systematic teaching, called catechesis, leading up to their baptism. Sadly, the practice of catechizing adults to any degree has declined to the point of ceasing altogether in most of today's churches. <i>To Be a Christian </i>aims to correct this. It is meant as a tool for all comers &#x2013; the adult inquirer, the new convert, and the long-time believer seeking deeper grounding in the full reality of Christian faith and life. Essential Christian instruction is presented in today's language, drawing on the three traditional foundations of catechesis: The Apostles' Creed, The Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments. <i></i></p> <p>Tens of millions of Anglicans on six continents trace their tradition back through the centuries to laymen like William Wilberforce, who led the abolition of the slave trade in England, to the bishops and martyrs of the English Reformation, like Thomas Cranmer, and to missionaries like Augustine of Canterbury and St. Patrick who spread the Gospel throughout the British Isles. A lucid statement of the Apostolic Faith that Anglicans share with all Christians, <i>To Be A Christian </i>is truly a resource for the entire Body of Christ. It is offered with the prayer that it may serve to build up the Body of Christ by helping many to full Christian faith, and faithfulness, in today's increasingly post-Christian world.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Super Science Book</h2><p>Here is the fifth title in the stunningly successful sequence that began in l996 with THE GREAT GRAMMAR BOOK.

Berger was the Ann C. Pingree Director of the Phillips Library at the Peabody Essex Museum of Salem; he is now the library&#x2019;s Director Emeritus. For the last nearly 14 years Dr. Berger has also been on the faculty of Simmons College and the University of Illinois in Urbana/Champaign, teaching rare book courses in both institutions&#x2019; library schools. He was also Curator of Printed Books and then Curator of Manuscripts at the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester, MA, and headed the Special Collections Department at the University of California at Riverside. He is widely published in several fields--mostly in literary, bibliographical, and library fields--and his most recent book, Rare Books and Special Collections, won the 2015 ABC-CLIO/American Library Association award for the Best Book in Library Literature. He makes paper and casts type by hand, and he is the proprietor of the Doe Press, publishing short texts from handset type, printed on a hand press.First published in 1952 with eight revised later editions, the ABC for Book Collectors by John Carter has long served as the standard glossary for the book trade. Nicely illustrated with photographs and drawings, The Dictionary of the Book updates Carter&#x2019;s classic volume with additional coverage on book-printing terms, typography, papermaking, and binding, among other topics. A former museum library director and curator of manuscripts at different institutions, Berger is highly qualified to compile this informative and important work. A venerable bibliophile who delights in all aspects of book production and history, he hopes the readers will get as much 'pleasure out of this book' as he did in compiling it. (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>An authority on rare books and special collections, Berger offers this dictionary for &#x2018;anyone who wants to speak intelligently about books&#x2014;to use the right terms in the right contexts and with the right meanings.&#x2019; The work begins with the ABA, the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association (&#x2018;the British organization of high-end booksellers&#x2019;), and concludes with Zinc Cuts (&#x2018;metal plates made from zinc that contain images for printing&#x2019;). Entries contain pertinent further readings cross-referenced with URLs where relevant. &#x2018;Online Books Sales&#x2019; is just one of many examples of informative entries of varying length. Five helpful appendixes discuss paper and paper-related terminology, typeface terminology, paper sizes, binding terminology, and book collectors' clubs and societies. The concluding, partly annotated bibliography usefully assembles many printed works and internet resources mentioned in the main dictionary.... The handsome work is sturdily bound for reference collection use in a quarto double-columned format with numerous black-and-white and color illustrations. Clearly written and updated for the present age....<br><br>Summing Up: Highly recommended. All readership levels. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>Berger&#x2019;s work will perhaps appeal most to the individual with a comparatively modest book budget and without ready institutional access to the OCB. Yet for institutional libraries catering for any element of book production or history, and for anybody who enjoys comparing descriptions in different dictionaries of the book, it is an essential addition to the corpus. (<i>Library &amp; Information History</i>)<br><br>I&#x2019;ve been racing through Sidney E. Berger&#x2019;s The Dictionary of the Book: A Glossary for Book Collectors, Booksellers, Librarians, and Others from cover to cover as if it was one of those unputdownable, page-turning blockbusters. This lively, wide-ranging, finely detailed glossary is high entertainment for bibliophiles of every stripe. Berger is a Renaissance bookman, at once scholar, collector, bibliographer, rare book-librarian, paper historian, curator, hand press printer and papermaker. Like John Carter before him, whose venerable ABC for Book Collectors often serves as the inspiration for this book collector&#x2019;s glossary, Berger is personal, witty and opinionated in the way he writes up these entries. We badly needed not just an update to Carter&#x2019;s ABC, but a fresh book-collecting glossary that is more in-depth, comprehensive, and scholarly&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s exactly what Sidney Berger&#x2019;s passionate dictionary is. . . .Berger means this for the use of scholars and bibliophiles alike. He wears his scholarship lightly and informally, making the whole task of writing and producing this book look easy, but a decade of work went into it, and of course, a lifetime of being a devout bibliophile. . . .Two reference works are now indispensable to the bibliophile: the Oxford Companion to the Book in two volumes, and now this portable one volume by Sidney Berger. I have been, since getting hold of his Dictionary of The Book, reaching for it so many times, I can&#x2019;t imagine how I&#x2014;or any bibliophile&#x2014;got along without it so far. (<i>The Hindu</i>)<br><br>With its plentiful illustrations and extensive &#x2013; and largely print &#x2013; bibliography, [The Dictionary of the Book] will be a valuable and often entertaining point of reference for people whose interest in physical books goes beyond simply collecting them. (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>Book terminology can be complicated and esoteric, but Berger&#x2019;s entries provide concise and often entertaining explanations for book history terms from papyrus to e books. Berger&#x2019;s Dictionary of the Book updates and expands the classic reference work on this topic, John Carter&#x2019;s ABC for Book Collectors, which was first published in 1952. In compiling his dictionary, Berger has drawn on his more than 40 years of experience as a special collections librarian, scholar, teacher, collector, and practitioner of the book arts.... Berger covers a wide range of subjects in a manner both clear and erudite. Berger&#x2019;s extensive experience in the library and the classroom is much in evidence: He understands what readers need to know about book history, and he knows how to explain it. From a technical services standpoint, Berger&#x2019;s dictionary is a useful addition to the reference shelf for anyone tasked with creating metadata that highlights the historic aspects of material texts. Berger&#x2019;s Dictionary of the Book is an accessible and comprehensive guide for anyone who needs to gain a vocabulary for talking about books and the processes that create them. (<i>Technical Services Quarterly</i>)<br><br>Berger is a passionate bibliomaniac with a scholar's eye for details and a bibliophile's eye for the beauty in the details. He takes a language defined (now) long ago by John Carter and refined more recently by Nicolas Barker and brings it into the 21st century with a deft blend of deference and irreverence and more than a dash of humor, to make learning the arcane patois of books an educational treat and a great read. He adds from his own vast knowledge and experience a fresh perspective which will delight beginners and cognoscenti alike, and offers us all a chance to look afresh at our world of books. (John Windle, Owner, John Windle Antiquarian Bookseller in San Francisco)<br><br>The Dictionary of the Book is a reference work that is as wide-ranging and encyclopedic as its author. Sid Berger has produced an essential tool for the trade. (Phil Salmon, Bromer Booksellers)<br><br>This is not an ABC of book terms, this is an A to Z of all things bookish! From bookbinding to paper making to library terminology, this glossary leaves nothing out and its definitions are clear, concise and on target. No librarian&#x2019;s shelf should be without it.

Mixed-signal IC test and measurement has grown into a highly specialized field of electrical engineering. However, test engineering is still a relatively unknown profession compared to IC design engineering. It has become harder to hire and train new engineers to become skilled mixed-signal test engineers. The slow learning curve for mixed-signal test engineers is largely due to the shortage of written materials and university-level courses on the subject of mixed-signal testing. While many textbooks have been devoted to the subject of digital test and testability, the same cannot be said for analog and mixed-signal automated test and measurement.<br> <em>An Introduction to Mixed-Signal IC Test and Measurement</em> is a textbook for advanced undergraduate and graduate-level students as well as engineering professionals. It was written in response to the shortage of basic course material for mixed-signal test and measurement. The book assumes a solid background in analog and digital circuits as well as a working knowledge of computers and computer programming. A background in digital signal processing and statistical analysis is also helpful, though not absolutely necessary.<br> This text encompasses the testing of both analog and mixed-signal circuits including many borderline examples. Digital testing is covered, but not as extensively because of the wealth of information on this topic already available. Examples and illustrations using state-of-the-art industrial technology enrich and enliven the presentation throughout. In considering the applications of this technology, the testing of large-scale mixed-signal circuits and individual circuits is introduced. The value-added benefits of mixed-signal IC testing to a manufacturer's product are clearly discussed, and the role of the test engineer is clearly defined.</p><p>Mark Burns is at Texas Instruments.

Its far-reaching recommendations stand as the most thorough attempt to ensure peace and progress around the world since the formation of the United Nations.<br> Conceived by the Commission on Global Governance, this vastly important book represents the collective thinking of twenty-eight eminent international figures from a variety of professional and public affairs backgrounds. Established in 1992 to analyze global changes in recent decades and to suggest ways in which the international community can better cooperate on global issues, the Commission works to capitalize on the myriad opportunities afforded the world community in the wake of the Cold War. Beginning with an analysis of the complex and contradictory effects of globalization and the end of the Cold War, this extensive report outlines the major transformations that have transpired over the last fifty years including the political, economic, military, technological, intellectual, and institutional changes that have so powerfully marked the second half of the twentieth century. In turn, it surveys the major problems, such as ethnic conflict, unemployment, environmental degradation, and extensive population growth, that have emerged from these transformations to confront world leaders.<br> In itself, the end of the Cold War has far from ended the world's problems. While the threat of nuclear superpower war has receded, the spread of nuclear capability and of biological and chemical weapons poses great dangers. Wars, between states and even more within states (such as the ongoing tragedy of both Yugoslavia and Rwanda), have continued to destroy lives. With this in mind, <em>Our Global Neighborhood</em> addresses the two principle norms that have guided relations among states, both before and after the Cold War: sovereignty and self-determination. It explains why these norms are still important and how they must be adapted to meet the new realities of the emerging global community. Discussing the importance of shared values in a time of transition, it identifies the values that the Commission believes most important, including justice, equity, tolerance, liberty, and nonviolence. And it goes on to call for a new global ethic based on a set of responsibilities and rights that would encourage cooperation and collaboration in a global neighborhood.<br> As the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations approaches in 1995, the adequacy of our institutions of global governance and the need to strengthen them will increasingly claim the attention of world leaders and citizens alike. The debates prompted by this anniversary lend a poignant timeliness to <em>Our Global Neighborhood</em> as it makes recommendations for changes in international organizations--especially those that are part of the United Nations system--such as revitalizing the General Assembly and reforming the Security Council.<br></p><p>As we approach the next century, a new world is taking shape. This world presents new dangers, new problems, and new challenges. But it also offers the real hope of creating a safer and more equitable era. The future is now in our hands. Our Global Neighbourhood points a way into the 21st century: it projects a strong world vision that is people-centred; it stresses the need for shared values, a global civic ethic, and enlightened leadership to guide people and nations in the global neighbourhood. It explores the challenges facing humanity and offers considered proposals: to promote the security of people and the planet, to manage the global economy, to reform the United Nations, and to strengthen the rule of law world-wide. The Commission on Global Governance is an independent group of 28 leaders with diverse experience and responsibilities. Their task has been to suggest ways in which our global community could better manage its affairs in a new time in human history. Our Global Neighbourhood is their collective response. Published in the 50th anniversary year of the founding of the United Nations, this book is essential reading about the future of the world and the fate of generations to come.The Commission on Global Governance was an organization established in 1992 and chaired by Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson.</p><h2>John Sloan on Drawing and Painting</h2><p>A highly regarded member of the Ashcan School of American painting, John Sloan (1871&#x2013;1951) was also an influential teacher at New York's Art Students League. His dual experience as a realist painter and a graphics illustrator helped equip Sloan with the uncommon capacity to instruct students in both representational and abstract art. Now, with this illustrated, practical record of his teachings, readers can benefit from the depth and variety of Sloan's talks on art theory and practice.<br>Transcribed and edited by Helen Farr, a student whom Sloan later married, the discussions begin with observations on drawing as the basis of visual art, including considerations of line, tone, texture, light and shade, composition, design, space, perspective, and related issues. Later chapters deal with figure drawing, painting, landscape and mural painting, painting technique (gesso grounds, tempera, and glazing), etching, and other media (aquatint, lithography, and watercolor). Sloan's discussion of color in the chapter on oil painting is especially detailed, with notes on harmony, use of set palettes, underpainting and glazing, line work, and much more.<br>Each chapter features a wealth of helpful suggestions and recommended exercise, along with Sloan's personal opinions of D�rer, Rubens, El Greco, and other masters, and his insights into their work: "Go to the masters to learn how to draw and paint. Study them, particularly the work you don't like. That is the road to advancement, that is the way to learn. But get your impulse to work from life."<br>This invaluable summary of art theory and practice&#x2014;by one of the great artists and teachers of the twentieth century&#x2014;is enhanced with 46 illustrations, including 23 of Sloan's paintings, 8 photographs of the artist and his studio, and a number of line drawings and diagrams.</p><p></p><h2>History of the French Revolution</h2><p>This is a pre-1923 historical reproduction that was curated for quality.

New Answers from the Frontiers of Science</h2><p>From the cutting edge of science and living spirituality: a guide to understanding our identity and purpose in the world <br><br>� Outlines the new understanding of matter and mind coming to light at the cutting edge of physics and consciousness research <br><br>� Explains how we can evolve consciously, become connected with each other, and flourish on this planet <br><br>� Includes contributions from Maria Sagi, Kingsley L. Dennis, Emanuel Kuntzelman, Dawna Jones, Shamik Desai, Garry Jacobs, and John R. Audette <br><br>For the outdated mainstream paradigm the world is a giant mechanism functioning in accordance with known and knowable laws and regularities. The new paradigm emerging in science offers a different concept: The world is an interconnected, coherent whole, and it is informed by a cosmic intelligence. This is not a finite, mechanistic-material world. It is a consciousness-infused whole-system world. We are conscious beings who emerge and co-evolve as complex, cosmic-intelligence in-formed vibrations in the Akashic Field of the universe. <br><br>Ervin Laszlo and his collaborators from the forefront of science, cosmology, and spirituality show how the re-discovery of who we are and why we are here integrates seamlessly with the wisdom traditions as well as with the new emerging worldview in the sciences, revealing a way forward for humanity on this planet. They explain how we have reached a point of critical incoherence and tell us that to save ourselves, our environment, and society, we need a critical mass of people to consciously evolve a new thinking. Offering a guidepost to orient this evolution, Laszlo examines the nature of consciousness in the universe, showing how our bodies and minds act as transmitters of consciousness from the intelligence of the cosmos and how understanding science&#x2019;s new concept of the world enables us to re-discover our identity and our purpose in our world. <br><br>With bold vision and forward thinking, Laszlo and his contributors Maria Sagi, Kingsley L. Dennis, Emanuel Kuntzelman, Dawna Jones, Shamik Desai, Garry Jacobs, and John R. Audette outline the new idea of the world and of ourselves in the world. They help us discover how we can overcome these divisive times and blossom into a new era of peace, coherence, connection, and global wellbeing.</p><p>Ervin Laszlo is a philosopher and systems scientist.

Reprint. PW.</p><p>German-born Billy Wilder (b. 1906) is one of the last survivors of Hollywood's Golden Age, the writer and director of seminal films like Double Indemnity, Some Like It Hot and his masterpiece, Sunset Boulevard. By naming this attempt at a definitive Wilder biography after the savagely humorous 1950 classic, Sikov (Laughing Hysterically: American Screen Comedy of the 1950s) invites a risky comparisonAand pulls it off with a broad, well-documented overview of Wilder's life and work. Considering Wilder "the fastest, funniest, meanest mind in Hollywood," Sikov admires his subject without succumbing to reverence. Wilder is an infamous raconteur, and Sikov wisely lets him hold forth on his self-made legend, including his acerbic assessments of fellow Hollywood players, his outrageous and wrenching accounts of Europe before and after WWII and his steely insights into American culture. Though the preface acknowledges that the work is "unauthorized," it presents so many Wilder quotes (of Raymond Chandler, "I was all that he hated about Hollywood"; of Audrey Hepburn, "After so many drive-in waitresses...here is class") and authoritative accounts of his comings and goings that it reads almost as if Wilder's own hand were behind it. The book's film criticism works best as a tool for gleaning Wilder's sensibility from his scripts and direction. The often irascible, always witty Wilder emerges from these pages as shrewd, eminent and, especially in comparison with today's tepid Hollywood fare, daringly authentic. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Sikov's unauthorized biography of moviemaker Billy Wilder is better written than Kevin Lally's <i>Wilder Times</i> (1996). Otherwise, it is remarkably similar, despite Lally's greater access to Wilder (Sikov confesses he shared Wilder's reaction to the prospect of interviewing for the book: "the idea . . . made him want to throw up"). Both books concentrate on Wilder's movies and their humorous cynicism and sullied idealism about life and love. Sikov places greater emphasis on Wilder's seeming mission to confront American pretensions to virtue with the seamy truth as he saw it; the central Wilder film, then, is the bitter <i>Ace in the Hole</i>, in which an opportunistic reporter transforms an accident into a media circus. Sikov also stresses Wilder's obsession with sexual vulgarity and depicts him as flouting respectability because he felt--prophetically, it turned out--that greater sexual candor onscreen was inevitable as well as honest. Like Lally, Sikov doesn't visually analyze Wilder's movies, and he can't make Wilder personally appealing, either. Still, Sikov's is the better overall appreciation of the monstrously amusing filmmaker. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>The Impossible State: Islam, Politics, and Modernity&#39;s Moral Predicament</h2><p>Wael B. Hallaq boldly argues that the "Islamic state," judged by any standard definition of what the modern state represents, is both impossible and inherently self-contradictory. Comparing the legal, political, moral, and constitutional histories of premodern Islam and Euro-America, he finds the adoption and practice of the modern state to be highly problematic for modern Muslims. He also critiques more expansively modernity's moral predicament, which renders impossible any project resting solely on ethical foundations. <br><br>The modern state not only suffers from serious legal, political, and constitutional issues, Hallaq argues, but also, by its very nature, fashions a subject inconsistent with what it means to be, or to live as, a Muslim. By Islamic standards, the state's technologies of the self are severely lacking in moral substance, and today's Islamic state, as Hallaq shows, has done little to advance an acceptable form of genuine Shari'a governance. The Islamists' constitutional battles in Egypt and Pakistan, the Islamic legal and political failures of the Iranian Revolution, and similar disappointments underscore this fact. Nevertheless, the state remains the favored template of the Islamists and the ulama (Muslim clergymen). <br><br>Providing Muslims with a path toward realizing the good life, Hallaq turns to the rich moral resources of Islamic history. Along the way, he proves political and other "crises of Islam" are not unique to the Islamic world nor to the Muslim religion. These crises are integral to the modern condition of both East and West, and by acknowledging these parallels, Muslims can engage more productively with their Western counterparts.</p><p>Wael B.

Arsenault recounts how in 1961, emboldened by federal rulings that declared segregated transit unconstitutional, a group of volunteers--blacks and whites--traveled together from Washington DC through the Deep South, defying Jim Crow laws in buses and terminals, putting their bodies and their lives on the line for racial justice. The book paints a harrowing account of the outpouring of hatred and violence that greeted the Freedom Riders in Alabama and Mississippi. One bus was disabled by Ku Klux Klansmen, then firebombed. In Birmingham and Montgomery, mobs of white supremacists swarmed the bus stations and battered the riders with fists and clubs while local police refused to intervene. The mayhem in Montgomery was captured by news photographers, shocking the nation, and sparking a crisis in the Kennedy administration, which after some hesitation and much public outcry, came to the aid of the Freedom Riders. Arsenault brings the key actors in this historical drama vividly to life, with colorful portraits of the Kennedys, Jim Farmer, John Lewis, Diane Nash, Fred Shuttlesworth, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Their courage, their fears, and the agonizing choices made by all these individuals run through the story like an electric current. <br> The saga of the Freedom Rides is an improbable, almost unbelievable story. In the course of six months, some four hundred and fifty Riders expanded the realm of the possible in American politics, redefining the limits of dissent and setting the stage in the years to come for the 1963 Birmingham demonstrations, Freedom Summer and the Selma-to-Montgomery March. With characters and plot lines rivaling those of the most imaginative fiction, this is a tale of heroic sacrifice and unexpected triumph.</p><p><br><strong>Raymond Arsenault</strong> is the John Hope Franklin Professor of Southern History and co-director of the Florida Studies Program at the University of South Florida, St. Petersburg. A graduate of Princeton and Brandeis, he is the author of two prize-winning books and numerous articles on race, civil rights, and regional culture.<br>The relationship between blacks and whites in North America had been a profound moral problem for at least a century before the United States itself was established. Slavery and general denigration of the humanity of blacks were deeply embedded in the culture by the time Gen. Washington assumed command of the Continental Army at Cambridge, Mass., in the late spring of 1775 and immediately issued an order to stop recruiting blacks. The problem was so thoroughly woven into the fabric of the nation that major advances in the fair treatment of blacks have occurred only once a century. The first period came in the 1780s and '90s, when northerners began applying revolutionary principle to daily life by abolishing slavery state by state. The second, of course, was the Civil War and Reconstruction period when the nation adopted the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments and Congress enacted strong civil rights legislation. The third period was the modern civil rights movement of the mid-20th century, and Raymond Arsenault's Freedom Riders focuses on one of its most pivotal struggles. <p>The 18th- and 19th-century reform movements significantly improved the lives of many blacks and also wrought changes in the hearts of many white Americans. However, the pervasive sludge of racism and racial privilege was too ingrained for reformers to be able to eliminate or even substantially curtail the profound and often brutal unfairness heaped on black citizens. Many blacks born in the first third of the 20th century concluded that segregation, then the most widespread and humiliating aspect of the racism that dogged their days, would not be ended in their lifetimes or even in their century.</p><p>But formal segregation was put to death by the civil rights movement between 1947 and 1972. There was no cataclysm on our soil comparable to the Revolution or the Civil War to spark the profound changes that occurred in the 1960s. What, then, set it off? In his dramatic and exhaustive account of the Freedom Riders, Arsenault makes a persuasive case that the idealism, faith, ingenuity and incredible courage of a relatively small group of Americans -- both white and black -- lit a fuse in 1961 that drew a reluctant federal government into the struggle -- and also enlarged, energized and solidified (more or less) the hitherto fragmented civil rights movement.</p><p>During the spring and summer of that year, the Freedom Riders set out to challenge segregation in interstate transport by taking more than 60 bus rides through the American South. The stage was set for their campaign by the idealism and democratizing impulses generated by World War II, the emergence of the black and brown former colonies as nations on the world stage and the dramatic and enormously successful arrival of Jackie Robinson at first base in a Brooklyn Dodgers uniform in 1947. Their effort was also bolstered by the Supreme Court ruling against public school segregation in 1954, the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955, and in the late '50s, a generally uncoordinated sprinkling of anti-segregation sit-ins across the South largely by students at black colleges and universities, particularly those conducted in Nashville by students at Tennessee State University. </p><p>But the 1961 campaign did not spring full-blown from the the youthful activists involved, including Diane Nash, John Lewis, Ruby Doris Smith, Jim Zwerg and Bernard Lafayette, or even their inspired mentor in Gandhian resistance, the Rev. James Lawson. The roots of these rides extended from an earlier campaign conducted by the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and its ally, the Fellowship of Reconciliation. Those groups were spurred by a 1946 case, Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia, brought by the NAACP, in which the Supreme Court ruled that segregation in interstate travel was unconstitutional and -- in the same year -- by the brutal blinding by nightstick in Batesburg, S.C., of Isaac Woodard, a black World War II veteran, over a slight altercation with the driver of the bus that was taking him home from the war.</p><p> They developed a plan for an interracial organized group-trip through the South to test compliance with the Supreme Court decision. The "Journey of Reconciliation" carried out in April 1947 through Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia revealed a bit of change in border states, a great deal of resistance (including from some cautious blacks) and some real danger. Its major achievement was to create the template for what was to follow 14 years later, when the stakes would be far higher.</p><p>By 1961 John F. Kennedy was in the White House, projecting youth, Cold War idealism, glamour and a can-do spirit. But for all of his �lan, Kennedy was a cautious Boston pol, who, like his brother Robert, the attorney general, was raised with a rich kid's blissful ignorance of blacks, poverty or segregation. Much of black America was at least quietly aquiver with the steady news of the rough, sometimes violent resistance to efforts to desegregate schools and lunch counters in the South. The Kennedy style suggested the possibility for change, but blacks and their allies reluctantly came to the realization that the Kennedys regarded what the movement thought was a moral crusade for constitutional justice as nothing more than another set of political problems to be handled.</p><p>As the Kennedys rose to power, the student movement began to cohere. It created its own umbrella group, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) while CORE became more demonstrative and venturesome. CORE also gained a new leader; James Farmer, a founder of the organization who had gone on to work on the NAACP national staff, returned to CORE as executive secretary. Farmer was a tall, burly, idealistic man blessed with a deep and impressive voice that he used to great effect in his new role. Martin Luther King Jr. had become a national figure and his Southern Christian Leadership Conference a force in the civil rights movement. So, even though his former colleagues, Bayard Rustin and George Houser, major actors behind the 1947 Reconciliation Ride, had drifted away, Farmer and his associates decided to make bold forays into the Deep South -- Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana -- to test whether the constitutional rights of interstate travelers were being honored and if not, what the federal government should do to enforce the law.</p><p>The first rides began in Washington on May 4, 1961, with Farmer and some of his top staffers on board a Trailways bus headed for New Orleans. "A proper test of the Morgan decision required a careful seating plan," Arsenault writes, "and Farmer left nothing to chance. Each group made sure that one black Freedom Rider sat in a seat normally reserved for whites, that at least one interracial pair of Riders sat in adjoining seats, and that the remaining Riders scattered throughout the bus." One Rider on each bus adhered to the conventions of Jim Crow travel, thus ensuring that at least one Rider could avoid arrest and contact supporters. Farmer later recalled that the Riders "were prepared for anything, even death." This started an intense period of approximately 16 months when Freedom Rides were at the center of the nation's civil rights struggle. There were iconic moments during those years: the burning of a Greyhound bus near Anniston, Ala., on May 14; the rampaging mob of racist thugs who, in the absence of any law enforcement restraint, beat Freedom Riders bloody in the Birmingham bus station the same day; the cracked skull of Attorney General Kennedy's personal assistant, John Seigenthaler, suffered as he gathered facts for his boss. But the larger story was harder to convey: Freedom Riders' dedication, raw courage and deep belief in constitutional idealism and the promises of America. Arsenault, the John Hope Franklin Professor of Southern History at the University of South Florida, tells that story in wonderfully rich detail. He explains how young people, knowing the brutality and danger that others had faced, nevertheless came to replace them -- in wave after wave -- to ride dangerous roads, to face lawless lawmen, to withstand the fury of racist mobs, to endure the squalor and danger of Southern jails -- even the dreaded Parchman Farm in Mississippi.</p><p>Some of this spirit was demonstrated by Diane Nash Bevel, one of the original leaders of the Nashville movement, who had become a national figure in her own right (and also the wife of Jim Bevel, who had also achieved fame as an outspoken aide to Martin Luther King Jr.), when she explained why she would go to jail for violating segregation laws even though she was pregnant.</p><p>"Some people have asked me how I can do this when I am expecting my first child in September. I have searched my soul about this and considered it in prayer. I have reached the conclusion that in the long run this will be the best thing I can do for my child. Since my child will be a black child, born in Mississippi, whether I am in jail or not, he will be born in prison. I believe that if I go to jail now it may help hasten that day when my child and all children will be free, not only on the day of their birth but for all of their lives." </p><p>The courage, power and moral elegance of that statement sums up how the Freedom Rides helped move the Kennedy administration into a more active civil rights role and inspired tens of thousands of formerly complacent citizens to become involved in the struggle. </p><p>One brief, final personal note: Arsenault scrapes some bark off many of the major civil rights leaders, but none so roughly as the NAACP and its then-leader, Roy Wilkins, my late uncle. I can attest to the fact that my childless uncle did not understand young people very well and was leery of activities that were essentially uncontrollable, and so was not an ardent fan of direct action such as Freedom Rides. It is fair to point out, though, that the NAACP was then essentially a litigating and civil rights lobbying organization. It takes nothing away from the massive contributions made by the Freedom Riders and other direct-action organizations to recognize that battles waged in the courts also made substantial contributions during this period. As a member of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, I saw the thunder coming up out of the direct-action movement that the NAACP and others turned into legislative proposals that created the laws and executive orders that became the foundations for the civil rights movement's lasting achievements.</p><p>Nonetheless, I entirely agree with a statement made by my former Justice Department colleague the late sociologist James Laue, and quoted by Arsenault: "The national mobilization of conscience which had begun in Montgomery and grown in 1960 reached full bloom with the Freedom Rides." To find out how that happened, one must read Arsenault's superb rendering of that great saga. For those interested in understanding 20th-century America, this is an essential book. </p><p>Reviewed by Roger Wilkins <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Volume 1 of the projected three-volume set covers <i>A-G</i>; volumes 2 (<i>H-R</i>) and 3 (<i>S-Z</i>) are scheduled for publication in 1996 and 1997, respectively. In his excellent 27-page introduction, Lighter, a research associate in the English department of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, traces the historical development of slang in the English language and discusses its sociological and cultural aspects. Following the introduction, Lighter provides a useful, annotated bibliography of significant books and articles dealing with American slang and an admirably thorough guide to the dictionary.<p>Defining slang as "an informal, nonstandard, nontechnical vocabulary composed chiefly of novel-sounding synonyms for standard words and phrases," Lighter notes that his intent in this compilation is to treat words and phrases that can be considered American slang, either presently or in the past. Therefore, some of the entries are for terms now considered colloquial or even Standard English (e.g., <i>bamboozle</i>, <i>cliffhanger</i>, <i>dandy</i>, <i>flapper</i>, <i>fluke</i>), but which were at one time viewed as slang. Other entries range from informal, inoffensive words and phrases that make our language more lively and interesting (e.g., <i>can of worms</i>, <i>circular file</i>, <i>foodaholic</i>, <i>goof off</i>, <i>grungy</i>) to terms that are generally considered offensive or vulgar, such as racial and ethnic epithets and expressions pertaining to sexual relations and body functions.</p><p>Entry headwords are arranged letter by letter (e.g., <i>bassackwards</i> precedes <i>bass fiddle</i>), with phrases usually appearing within the entry for the main word of the phrase. Abbreviated field labels indicating that a particular group of people uses the word (e.g., military, underground) precede the definition when appropriate. Usage and status labels are used to indicate other aspects of a term, for instance, whether it is usually considered vulgar or offensive or whether it is generally used jocularly or derisively.</p><p>The approximately 20,000 definitions included in this volume are models of succinctness. Following each definition are illustrative quotations, which are arranged chronologically, beginning with the earliest documented use. These quotations, which are the true heart of each entry, serve not only to document a word's usage at a particular time but also to further elucidate its meaning. Culled from a wide variety of written and oral sources, including literary works, popular novels, other dictionaries, magazines, newspapers, motion pictures, television programs, and anonymous conversations, the more than 90,000 quotations in this volume range from the seventeenth century to the 1990s. The degree of currency is particularly impressive since a number of 1993 sources, and at least one 1994 publication, are represented. A complete list of the approximately 8,000 sources cited throughout the dictionary will not appear until volume 3. This delay may prove problematic for users trying to locate the source of a quotation because titles are provided in abbreviated form. For example Nathan McCall's <i>Makes Me Wanna Holler</i> is referred to as "N. McCall, <i>Wanna Holler</i>."</p><p>While there is no denying that perusing the pages of this volume can rattle one's sensibilities, the increasing permissiveness regarding language in today's society cannot be ignored. Only a decade or so ago, many of the words in this work were considered taboo, not just in polite society but also in the mass media. Today the infamous <i>f</i> word and words and phrases of similar ilk are cropping up in song lyrics, films, television programs, literary works, and mainstream magazines. The increasing usage and heightened awareness of such terms are not only reflected in this volume, but also make its publication even more timely and appropriate.</p><p>When completed, Lighter's dictionary will be, without a doubt, the most definitive and scholarly treatment of American slang ever published. Most academic and large public libraries will want to add this work, since its historical treatment complements the coverage of slang terms in the <i>Dictionary of American Regional English</i> and <i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i>. Getting down to the nitty-gritty, Lighter evidently is cooking with gas because he has done a bang-up job in compiling this tome. In short, it's awesome, fantabulous, rad, the cat's meow! <i></i></p></p><h2>JavaScript: A Beginner&#39;s Guide, Fourth Edition</h2><p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b> Fully updated for the latest JavaScript standard and featuring a new chapter on HTML5 and jQuery</b></p><p><i>JavaScript: A Beginner's Guide</i> shows how to create dynamic Web pages complete with special effects using today's leading Web development language.

In 1928, he visited Paris for the first time and fell in with a number of avant-garde writers and artists, including James Joyce. In 1937, he settled in Paris permanently. Beckett wrote in both English and French, though his best-known works are mostly in the latter language. A prolific writer of novels, short stories, and poetry, he is remembered principally for his works for the theater, which belong to the tradition of the Theater of the Absurd and are characterized by their minimalist approach, stripping drama to its barest elements. In 1969, Beckett was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature and commended for having "transformed the destitution of man into his exaltation." Beckett died in Paris in 1989.<br><br>At the age of seventy-six he said: "With diminished concentration, loss of memory, obscured intelligence... the more chance there is for saying something closest to what one really is. Even though everything seems inexpressible, there remains the need to express. A child need to make a sand castle even though it makes no sense. In old age, with only a few grains of sand, one has the greatest possibility."

Through these lively characters, White paints a vivid picture of life on a skip - jack, a wooden oystering sailboat as they dredge for oysters&#x20ac;&#x201d;a favorite staple of iconic American seafood cuisine for over a hundred years. But this last vestige of American sailing culture is rapidly dying. State officials have mismanaged the waters, putting sport above business, and modernization above tradition. These captains must set aside their rivalry to fight for their very livelihood. With so many obstacles, it is not certain the fleet will survive the season. Hinging on its success, the viability of the nation&#x20ac;&#x2122;s premiere estuary and the survival of a classic American town hang dangerously in the balance.</p><p><p>CHRISTOPHER WHITE has written several books and has been published in <i>National Geographic, Exploration, Chesapeake Journal</i>, and multiple other publications. He lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.</p><p>Prologue <br>Come late March along the Chesapeake, winter often <br>lingers, reluctant to let go. The pattern is familiar: A <br>nor&#x2019;wester shuttles in a cold front from the Canadian plains and thoughts of spring are pirated off to sea. The night air drops to freezing, rebounding just a fraction&#x2014;perhaps into the low forties&#x2014;by noon the next day. The sun climbs high and the wind lessens. But the Bay itself remains frigid. Its waters are slow to revive; they stay wintry till May. Only then will hibernating crabs emerge from their muddy repose. Yes, four or five weeks till any market, the locals say. Oyster dredging is over, and the crabs haven&#x2019;t started to crawl. In the idiom of the Chesapeake, it&#x2019;s &#x201c;slack time.&#x201d; Slack season, especially when the weather is raw. <br>On one of those cold, slack nights&#x2014;neither winter nor spring&#x2014;I drove a little too fast down Route 33 on Maryland&#x2019;s Eastern Shore, the left bank of the Chesapeake, toward Tilghman Island, to board the skipjack Rebecca T. Ruark before she left port. Built in 1886, she was among the last sailboats still employed in commercial fi shing in North America. Only nineteen of her sister skipjacks remained. The wind- powered fleet had just completed another season dredging oysters from the bottom of the Bay&#x2014;by sail, the only legal way to dredge for these shellfish in Maryland, most of the week. To some an anachronism, to others a symbol of sustainability, skipjacks had been dredging on the Bay since the 1880s, and I had always wanted to see one up close&#x2014;before they disappeared. <br>But my mind was elsewhere. The LED numbers on the car&#x2019;s digital clock warned: 3:10. Rebecca would depart the dock in twenty minutes. I was running late. <br>The evening before, on the phone, Captain Wade Murphy had said I should arrive at the wharf by three thirty. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll eat breakfast on the way to the orster beds,&#x201d; he had said, startling me. I had actually blinked. The first time you hear &#x201c;three thirty&#x201d; from a &#x201c;waterman&#x201d;&#x2014;the Chesapeake name for a fi sherman&#x2014;you fi gure he must be talking about the afternoon. But he isn&#x2019;t. Murphy had said to get a good night&#x2019;s sleep; tomorrow would be a long day. <br>I had known Wade Murphy since the early 1980s, when I worked as a biologist for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, a local conservation group. More recently, as a science writer, I had interviewed him at public hearings on the Bay&#x2019;s troubled fi sheries, to get the waterman&#x2019;s point of view. Captain Murphy, fi fty-fi ve, was outspoken&#x2014; proud of Rebecca and his place as one of the few sailing captains left on the Bay. And since skipjacks were the last commercial sailing fl eet in North America, he had a sense of his place in history as well. When I saw Murphy at the March shellfi sh hearing, where watermen and state officials debated the reality of the oyster crisis, he invited me to observe seed oystering&#x2014;what they call &#x201c;spatting&#x201d;&#x2014; aboard Rebecca during the annual restocking season. <br>&#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t drudging again &#x2019;til November,&#x201d; he had said at the meeting. &#x201c;But right now we&#x2019;re planting seed for harvest in two or three years. If ya&#x2019;d like to go spatting one day, ye&#x2019;re welcome to it. Just don&#x2019;t be late.&#x201d; Watermen are known for being punctual&#x2014;it is an obsession, though nothing else in their lives is kept up to date. As keepers of an ancient art, they abide by a different calendar. <br>At this, their most crucial moment in history&#x2014;the likely crash of the oyster&#x2014;the majority of watermen stuck to their old ways: independent, stubborn, distrustful of others. Thus, for two weeks I had been talking to scientists and resource managers, getting only half the story. Oysters, like other Chesapeake fisheries, had peaked years ago (15 million bushels in 1884), and more recently&#x2014;after years in the 2-million- bushel range&#x2014;had plummeted, dipping below 200,000 bushels in 1996. Formerly the nation&#x2019;s largest producer of shellfish, the Chesapeake was no longer king of the American oyster. But what was causing the drop in landings? Overharvesting or mismanagement? Pollution or shellfish disease? The usual suspects. Some environmentalists claimed the fishery would vanish in a couple of years unless a ban on harvesting was imposed. Others said a moratorium wouldn&#x2019;t work. The camps were divided. But I had not yet heard the waterman&#x2019;s view, on his own ground&#x2014;in the middle of the Bay. His opinion would likely be telling. More than the fishery was at stake for the waterman. At stake was his way of life, a lineage for Wade Murphy going back three generations. <br>So I was quick to accept Murphy&#x2019;s unexpected invitation&#x2014;to observe oystermen at work. An equal attraction was the chance simply to ride aboard a skipjack, the last in a long line of oyster &#x201c;dredge boats&#x201d; that have plied the waters of the Bay. One thousand boats had fallen to twenty; my voyage was likely to be one of the last. Like a passage to some far horizon, today&#x2019;s sail held many promises, any one of which was enough justification for me to get up in the middle of a frigid night. <br>Tilghman Island&#x2014;home port to more than half the remaining skipjack fleet&#x2014;lay twenty miles down the road. From the landscape, each mile traveled could have been another ten years regressed into the past. After bypassing the town of Easton and the Black &amp; Decker power tool plant, the road to Tilghman had become more rural and serpentine. Streetlights vanished. Shoulders disappeared. Years peeled away. Under the moonlight, empty fi elds stretched away from the road like black cloaks. A river appeared to the right&#x2014;the Miles&#x2014;and a hump of an old bridge took me over Oak Creek. The car shimmied with a gust of wind. <br>Up ahead the Victorian architecture of St. Michaels, a former watermen&#x2019;s haunt, loomed into view. Gingerbread houses. Antique stores. Real estate offices. A maritime museum. The residents of St. Michaels no longer lived exclusively off the water. Here Chesapeake workboats were artifacts of history, not the living skipjacks I expected down the road. <br>I recalculated the distance: twelve miles to go. The clock said: &#x201c;3:15.&#x201d; Fifteen minutes left. Three small bedroom communities were perched along the hooked peninsula between St. Michaels and Tilghman, a limblike appendage known as Bay Hundred. Gabled homes from the days of schooner captains loomed in the moonlight. <br>The last five miles to Tilghman Island lasted forever. The clock gave me nine minutes. Watermen houses now lined the highway; crab pots overflowed from pickup trucks onto front lawns. Then, up ahead, I spied the tall masts of the skipjacks across Knapps Narrows, the slim channel dividing Tilghman from the peninsula. The half- dozen, fi fty-foot sailboats rose out of the dark water like white ghosts. The drawbridge was down. On it a sign offered fresh bait: eel and bull lips and a phone number. Tilghman Island, one of the last authentic watermen villages around. <br>As I sped across the drawbridge, the iron grates clanked under my tires. Looking left toward the Choptank River, I saw the running lights of a dozen low-lying workboats getting under way. Beyond them, two tall skipjacks were silhouetted in the moonlight near the eastern entrance to the narrows. To my right&#x2014;west toward the Bay&#x2014;the treelike masts of four more dredge boats lined the channel, their white sails aloft. My heart raced a little. I had stepped back into the Age of Sail. Like a time traveler, I had entered another world. <br>Each of the six skipjacks was over seventy-five years old; under the spotlights of the wharf, they looked their age. After a long winter of dredging in storms and ice, the two-sail wooden boats needed dry dock and a coat of paint. Their former bright-white sides were a dull gray. The gold leaf on their trail boards and nameplates had peeled, and the vintage dredges were rust-red. But despite being rundown, they had assembled in Knapps Narrows for one more task before retiring for the summer&#x2014;carrying seed oysters (spat) thirty miles up the Bay, to plant them for eventual harvest. The state would pay for their trouble. For the past two years dredge boats had moved young oysters from saltier southern waters, where a shellfi sh disease was rampant, to northern, where they were more likely to grow and survive. <br>The wharves resembled a nineteenth-century painting and were brimming with activity. Men, in pairs, lifted baskets onto the boats. Captains called on their crews to hurry. Hand over hand, men raised sails to dry them out from yesterday&#x2019;s rain. Others ran down the rickety pier, the boards warped and buckled like broken piano keys. The whole entourage moved in concert, with the purpose of a racing crew. The air smelled of brine, and I inhaled it deeply, leaving the window down as I scanned the docks for Rebecca. I spotted her southwest of the bridge. <br>Thanks to strong currents, the narrows was ice free throughout the winter. For this reason, during much of the past thirty- two years, Wade Murphy has tied up his fi rst skipjack, Sigsbee (1901), and (more recently) Rebecca, to Buck Garvin&#x2019;s dock on the narrows. It was shallow there, and the captain had to raise each boat&#x2019;s centerboard to gain clearance. I pulled into Buck&#x2019;s yard, grabbed my thermos, and ran toward the dock. Sails were flapping in the breeze, the rigging rattling against the mast. These gentle sounds were suddenly interrupted by a loud backfire as an engine gasped, sputtered, and then conked out. <br>My wristwatch glowed &#x201c;3:25 a.m.&#x201d; as I crossed the deck of Sigsbee and jumped aboard Rebecca, spanning three feet of open water, just as the crew cast off the bow line. &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s about time,&#x201d; the captain barked through the dark. He was tall and lanky, like a teenager, and clean-shaven. The rest of his features were obscured by the night. I said good morning to Captain Murphy, noting that I was five mi...</p></p><h2>Luminous Debris: Reflecting on Vestige in Provence and Languedoc</h2><p>Interpreting vestige with the eloquence of a poet and the knowledge of a field archaeologist, Gustaf Sobin explores his elected terrain: the landscapes of Provence and Languedoc. Drawing on prehistory, protohistory, and Gallo-Roman antiquity, the twenty-six essays in this book focus on a particular place or artifact for the relevance inherent in each. A Bronze Age earring or the rippling wave pattern in Massiolite ceramic are more than archival curiosities for Sobin. Instead they invite inquiry and speculation on existence itself: Artifacts are read as realia, and history as an uninterrupted sequence of object lessons.<br><br>As much travel writing as meditative discourse, <i>Luminous Debris</i> is enhanced by a prose that tracks, questions, and reflects on the materials invoked. Sobin engages the reader with precise descriptions of those very materials and the messages to be gleaned from their examination, be they existential, ethical, or political.<br><br>An American expatriate living in Provence for the past thirty-five years, Gustaf Sobin shares his enthusiasm for his adopted landscape and for a vertical interpretation of its strata.

Gustaf Sobin's prose combines descriptive precision with evocative power, calling to mind the poetic-scholarly writing of Barthes or Bachelard.

He found that the visions of the Hebrew prophets--such as Ezekiel, Moses, Adam, and Daniel--were strikingly similar to those of the volunteers in his DMT studies. Carefully examining the concept of prophecy in the Hebrew Bible, he characterizes a &#x201c;prophetic state of consciousness&#x201d; and explains how it may share biological and metaphysical mechanisms with the DMT effect. <br> <br>Examining medieval commentaries on the Hebrew Bible, Strassman reveals how Jewish metaphysics provides a top-down model for both the prophetic and DMT states, a model he calls &#x201c;theoneurology.&#x201d; Theoneurology bridges biology and spirituality by proposing that the Divine communicates with us using the brain, and DMT--whether naturally produced or ingested--is a critical factor in such visionary experience. This model provides a counterpoint to &#x201c;neurotheology,&#x201d; which proposes that altered brain function simply generates the impression of a Divine-human encounter. <br> <br>Theoneurology addresses issues critical to the full flowering of the psychedelic drug experience. Perhaps even more important, it points the way to a renewal of classical prophetic consciousness, the soul of Hebrew Bible prophecy, as well as unexpected directions for the evolution of contemporary spiritual practice.</p><p>Rick Strassman, M.D., is clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine and president and cofounder of the Cottonwood Research Foundation.

Why do some people keep guns at home, despite scientific evidence of risk to their family members? And why do people use antibiotics for illnesses they cannot possibly alleviate? When it comes to health, many people insist that science is wrong, that the evidence is incomplete, and that unidentified hazards lurk everywhere. <br><br>In<em> Denying to the Grave</em>, Gorman and Gorman, a father-daughter team, explore the psychology of health science denial. Using several examples of such denial as test cases, they propose six key principles that may lead individuals to reject "accepted" health-related wisdom: the charismatic leader; fear of complexity; confirmation bias and the internet; fear of corporate and government conspiracies; causality and filling the ignorance gap; and the nature of risk prediction. The authors argue that the health sciences are especially vulnerable to our innate resistance to integrate new concepts with pre-existing beliefs. This psychological difficulty of incorporating new information is on the cutting edge of neuroscience research, as scientists continue to identify brain responses to new information that reveal deep-seated, innate discomfort with changing our minds. <br><br><em>Denying to the Grave</em> explores risk theory and how people make decisions about what is best for them and their loved ones, in an effort to better understand how people think when faced with significant health decisions.

We begin in Africa, with the growth of the slave trade, and follow the forced migration of what is estimated to be between ten and twenty million people, witnessing the terrible human cost of slavery in the colonies of England and Spain. We read of the Haitian Revolution, which ended victoriously in 1804 with the birth of the first independent black nation in the New World, and of slave rebellions and resistance in the United States in the years leading up to the Civil War. There are vivid accounts of the Civil War and Reconstruction years, the backlash of notorious "Jim Crow" laws and mob lynchings, and the founding of key black educational institutions. The contributors also trace the migration of blacks to the major cities, the birth of the Harlem Renaissance, the hardships of the Great Depression and the service of African Americans in World War II, the struggle for Civil Rights in the 1950s and '60s, and the emergence of today's black middle class.<br> From Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King, Jr., and Louis Farrakhan, <em>To Make Our World Anew</em> is an unforgettable portrait of a people.<br></p><p>Since nearly any history of African Americans is bound to be compared to John Hope Franklin's masterwork <i>From Slavery to Freedom</i>, perhaps it's best to state straightaway that <i>To Make Our World Anew</i> does indeed measure up to, and on some levels surpass, Franklin's epochal work. In this impressive multidisciplinary book, professors Robin D.G. Kelley and Earl Lewis bring together nine scholars, including Colin Palmer, Vincent Harding, Peter Wood, and Barbara Blair, to outline the 500-year African American experience, from the Middle Passage to the Million Man March. "The history of African Americans is nothing less than the dramatic saga of a people attempting to remake the world," Kelley and Lewis write. "Even when they did not succeed, the actions, thoughts, and dreams of Africans are responsible for some of the most profound economic, political, and cultural developments in the modern west." Every aspect of the African American experience is explored: slavery, slave rebellions, emancipation, segregation, lynchings, civil rights, and the post civil rights era. Major figures like Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Harriet Tubman are highlighted, as are the lesser-known exploits of Esteban, the Afro-Moorish slave who "discovered" New Mexico and Arizona, and Henry "Box" Brown, the Virginia slave who escaped to freedom by putting himself in a coffin-like box that was shipped to Philadelphia. The book is particularly strong on late-20th-century social issues, with insightful coverage of the attack on affirmative action and the impact of immigration, crack cocaine, and AIDS on the black community. <i>To Make Our World Anew</i> is essential reading for anyone interested in the black American experience. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i><br><strong>Robin D.

Based on a classic fourteenth-century Tibetan poem famous for its ability to awaken compassion in the human heart, this elegant primer combines the mind training and stages of the path traditions of Tibetan Buddhism with enduring simplicity and illuminating prose.</p></p><p>The second volume by His Holiness the Dali Lama in the <i>Library of Tibet</i> series shows how to awaken compassion for others and motivates us to better our world.<br> His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.

Westerners may be confused by the book's title, assuming that it focuses solely on Buddhist meditation and prayer techniques. Though it does address meditation and prayer, at its core this is a book that demonstrates how day-to-day living can be a spiritual practice. There are two ways to create happiness:<blockquote>The first is external. By obtaining better clothes, better shelter, and better friends we can find a certain measure of happiness and satisfaction. The second is through mental development, which yields inner happiness. However, these two approaches are not equally viable. External happiness cannot last long without its counterpart.... However, if you have peace of mind you can find happiness even under the most difficult circumstances.</blockquote> As he has in previous books (<i>An Open Heart</i>, <i>The Art of Happiness</i>), the Dalai Lama reminds us that developing peace of mind means paying attention to our daily attitudes and choices as well as taking the time to meditate and be prayerful. The six-part book covers Buddhist meditation techniques and visualization exercises as well as daily thoughts and actions that foster morality and wisdom. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><b>His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama,</b> Tenzin Gyatso, was born in 1935 to a peasant family in northeastern Tibet and was recognized at the age of two as the reincarnation of his predecessor, the Thirteenth Dalai Lama. The world's foremost Buddhist leader, he travels extensively, speaking eloquently in favor of ecumenical understanding, kindness and compassion, respect for the environment, and, above all, world peace.<br><br><b>Jeffrey Hopkins, Ph.D.,</b> served for a decade as the interpreter for the Dalai Lama.

While slavery has always caused considerable social and psychological tension, Western culture has associated it with certain religious and philosophical doctrines that gave it the highest sanction. The contradiction of slavery grew more profound when it became closely linked with American colonization, which had as its basic foundation the desire and opportunity to create a more perfect society. Davis provides a comparative analysis of slave systems in the Old World, a discussion of the early attitudes towards American slavery, and a detailed exploration of the early protests against Negro bondage, as well as the religious, literary, and philosophical developments that contributed to both sides in the controversies of the late eighteenth century. This exemplary introduction to the history of slavery in Western culture presents the traditions in thought and value that gave rise to the attitudes of both abolitionists and defenders of slavery in the late eighteenth century as well as the nineteenth century.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Brion Davis</strong> is Sterling Professor of History at Yale University and President of the Organization of American Historians.

Routledge is an imprint of Taylor &amp; Francis, an informa company.</p><p>Richard Sipe examines the continuing sexual crisis facing the Catholic Church today. Has the storm of publicity and controversy caused the church to acknowledge any of the accusations? Will the church accept statistical evidence or alter the way it trains its clergy? How has it come to grips with reforming or retraining abusers? Has it acknowledged the spread of AIDS among its ranks? Why does the church oppress women and react with hostility and fear towards them? Sex, Priests, and Power: Anatomy of a Crisis addresses these and other questions.For more than 30 years, psychotherapist Sipe has been engaged in research on the institution and practice of priestly celibacy. He has reported and interpreted that research before, but this book takes it as background for a more thorough examination of the entanglement of sexuality and power in the historical development of the Roman Catholic Church. Given the pervasiveness of the entanglement, the book becomes a case study of sorts, with implications beyond the boundaries of Roman Catholicism and beyond the practice of celibacy. Among the most interesting and important aspects of the book is its systematic application of sociobiology to a concrete moral--and political--problem. That sociobiology shares with Roman Catholic theology a profound appreciation for the "natural" as an ethical category makes this a promising venture--and it carries it beyond the potential trivialities of expose{&#x201a;} or polemic. This is a thoughtful book, informed not only by the headlines but also by a deep respect for celibacy and for the Roman Catholic tradition as well as the "systemic" insights of sociobiology. <i>Steve Schroeder</i></p><h2>Thoreau: On Man and Nature</h2><p>On Man and Nature by Henry David Thoreau 1960</p><p></p><h2>Food For Free (Collins Gem)</h2><p><p>The ideal portable companion, the world-renowned Collins Gem series returns with a fresh new look and updated material.</p><p>This is the perfect pocket guide for aspiring foragers.

He packs his refreshingly open-minded approach to food and his straight-shooting personality ("I come from a long line of wise guys," he says happily) and takes them on the road to the chefs' home turf in kitchens around the country.

"But."</i><br>Eighteen-year-old auto mechanic Sawyer Taft did not expect her estranged grandmother to show up at her apartment door and offer her a six-figure contract to participate in debutante season. And she definitely never imagined she would accept. But when she realizes that immersing herself in her grandmother's "society" might mean discovering the answer to the biggest mystery of her life-her father's identity-she signs on the dotted line and braces herself for a year of makeovers, big dresses, bigger egos, and a whole lot of <i>bless your heart</i>. The one thing she doesn't expect to find is friendship, but as she's drawn into a group of debutantes with scandalous, dangerous secrets of their own, Sawyer quickly discovers that her family isn't the only mainstay of high society with skeletons in their closet. There are people in her grandmother's glittering world who are not what they appear, and no one wants Sawyer poking her nose into the past. As she navigates the twisted relationships between her new friends and their powerful parents, Sawyer's search for the truth about her own origins is just the beginning.<br>Set in the world of debutante balls, grand estates and rolling green hills, <i>Little White Lies </i>combines a charming setting, a classic fish-out-of-water story, and the sort of layered mystery only author Jennifer Lynn Barnes can pull off. <br></p><p><b>Jennifer Lynn Barnes</b> has written more than a dozen acclaimed young adult novels, including The Naturals series: <i>The Naturals</i>, <i>Killer Instinct</i>, <i>All In</i>, <i>Bad Blood</i> and the e-novella, <i>Twelve</i>.

The power and the beauty of fractals were only capable of being seen with the advent of computers, which become psychedelic windows on the infinite when using simple fractal equations. <br><br>In 1992 Nigel Lesmoir-Gordon made the TV documentary, The Colors of Infinity about the Mandelbrot Set and fractals, which has since been seen right round the world. Nigel&#x2019;s enthusiasm brought together a dream team of contributors for the film who all now contribute to the book tracking how fractals have developed since the film was made. Sir Arthur C Clarke presented the film and in the book gives a lucidly simple account of the mathematics of the M-Set. Benoit Mandelbrot, the Belgian mathematician explains how it began. Professor Michael Barnsley, the computer graphics researcher who developed fractal image compression technology, explains the applications of the breakthroughs. Professor Ian Stewart, author of Does God Play Dice? adds his insights into the beautifully simple equation that gives birth to fractals. <br><br>Two of the most interesting applications of fractal geometry, reflected by the two new contributors to the book, are to the Internet and to the Stock Market. Dr Gary Flake, Chief Technology Officer at Overture, the leading provider of commercial search on the Internet and just taken over by Yahoo for 1.6 billion dollars, discusses the profoundly fractal nature of the Web in his article: The Self-ish Web. Robert Prechter Jr is President of Elliott Wave International, Inc. and founder of the Socionomics Institute. His latest title is Socionomics: The Science of History and Social Prediction (2003).

Bless them for this book."<br> --Joyce DeShano, board chair, Ascension Health</p><p>We live in organizations that are more interested in controlling and predicting behavior than understanding it. We view freedom as a problem to be managed rather than the essence of all motivation and creativity. If we can deepen our understanding of what it means to be a human being, we can become leaders who discover and create meaning no matter where we work or what we do for a living. Freedom and Accountability at Work is a provocative book on leadership and the workplace that celebrates leadership as a challenge in philosophical reflection as opposed to a set of behaviors and skills to be honed for success. Written in collaboration by noted philosophy professor Peter Koestenbaum and renowned business consultant Peter Block, Freedom and Accountability at Work is a leading-edge and practical book that draws on the co-authors&#39; combined wisdom and expertise. Koestenbaum and Block offer you a new way of thinking about effective leadership. They present a deeper understanding of how to handle the most difficult of human emotions including uncertainty, anxiety, guilt, and anger. These subjective realities of each of our lives can become our allies and sources of strength if we view them from a philosophical viewpoint. Throughout the book, the authors make constructive suggestions for overcoming the feelings of helplessness and isolation that are a product of our technology-dominant culture. Freedom and Accountability at Work reveals how you can make the transition from a science- and psychology-based view of the world to an understanding based on philosophy and the search for meaning and ethics. The authors emphasize the power and value of deepening your appreciation, even changing your mind, about what it means to be human in a world that is driven by speed, technology, and quick-fix solutions. Integrating the wisdom and insights in Freedom and Accountability at Work into your everyday life can help bring meaning, purpose, and hope to your ever- changing and often chaotic world.

In their own words, they portray how their divergent thinking skills could be put to great use if they were given an opportunity. Many such students never get the chance because the same sensitivity that gives them these insights makes the flicker of fluorescent lights and the sound of chalk on the board unbearable For simple&#x2014;and easily remedied&#x2014;reasons, we lose these students, who are as gifted as they are challenged.<br><br><i>Aquamarine Blue 5</i> is a showcase of the strength and resilient character of individuals with Asperger&#x2019;s Syndrome.

She is the author of the best-selling memoir <i>Songs of the Gorilla Nation: My Journey through Autism</i>. Her other books include <i>Gorillas among Us: A Primate Ethnographer</i>.</p>Prince-Hughes, an adjunct professor of anthropology and author of a book about gorillas, prefaces the essays in this collection with biographical information about each writer. Crediting the Internet with a rise of an "autistic culture," the editor goes on to differentiate between classic autism and Asperger's syndrome (AS), a condition with which she herself struggles. Each contributor tells his or her story, helping to illuminate problems with relationships, communication, obsessions, sensory channels, jobs, etc. Moreover, the special talents of these bright individuals and their coping mechanisms come to light. Here neurotypicals, autistics' label for "normals," can get hints about using counterquestions to promote better conversations, and those with AS can follow suggestions such as seeing a career counselor before choosing a college major. Sharing their trials and tribulations, these adults offer their communities a certain expertise, especially in libraries and universities, where people with such conditions are often successful. <i>Nancy McCray</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Western students have observed that religion and magic pervade not only the forms of Tibetan art, politics, and society, but also every detail of ordinary human existence. And what is the all-pervading religion of Tibet? The Buddhism of that country has been described to us, of course, but that does not mean the question has been answered. The unique importance of Stephan Beyer�s work is that it presents the vital material ignored or slighted by others: the living ritual of Tibetan Buddhists. The reader is made a witness to cultic proceedings through which the author guides him carefully. He does not force one to accept easy explanations nor does he direct one&#39;s attention only to aspects that can be counted on to please. He leads one step by step, without omitting anything, through entire rituals, and interprets whenever necessary without being unduly obtrusive. Oftentimes, as in the case of the many hymns to the goddess Tara, the superb translations speak directly to the reader, and it is indeed as if the reader himself were present at the ritual.</p><p>&#x201c;An outstanding achievement&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;The magnitude of this work is awesome&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>Virginia Quarterly Review</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;A major milestone in the subject&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Dazzlingly brilliant&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>Philosophy East and West</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;A quintessential resource for the study of Tibetan Buddhist religion and ritual&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>The Tibetan and Himalayan Library</i>Steven Beyer has Ph.D. degrees in religious studies and in psychology, and has taught as an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, the University of California, Berkeley, and the Graduate Theological Union.&nbsp;Beyer is an independent scholar doing research and fieldwork in ethnobotany, shamanism, ethnomedicine, and hallucinogenic plants and fungi, with a focus on indigenous and shamanic healing systems and the cognitive psychology of anomalous experiences.

Teeming with gigantic insects, spaceships, and scantily clad heroines, the science fiction pulp and paperback covers of the 1920s to 1960s represented a generation&#x2019;s vision of the future. Wartime technology and increased information about space travel fueled the minds of artists and writers. Predictions of planetary doom stood side by side with visions of Utopia on bookshelves and magazine racks worldwide. In WORLDS OF TOMORROW, more than 300 beautifully displayed science fiction covers come back to life in text and chapters grouped by theme. Explore the creative geniuses that molded our vision of the great unknown into what it is today.</p><p>* More than 300 classic international science fiction paperback, pulp, and book covers. <br>* Summer release coincides with Paramount Pictures&#x2019; Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow and 20th Century Fox&#x2019;s I, Robot.As citizens of planet Earth, we owe a lot to the great science fiction writers, illustrators, and moviemakers of the past century. From their gleaming, towering, futuristic cities come architectural inspiration. From their prophecies and positive thinking come true scientific discoveries and investigation. From their predictions of war and devastation come humility and humanity. <p>The artwork displayed on the covers of these publications fueled much more than children&#x2019;s imaginations. It fueled the minds of future physicists, scientists, and scholars. It challenged society to explore preconceived notions of humanness through the guise of robots and androids. Rocket ships and flying saucers fed a timeless wanderlust, while ray guns served as a reminder of mankind&#x2019;s destructive capacity. </p><p>Authors Forrest J Ackerman and Brad Linaweaver partner their unique insight and mutual admiration for each other in an engaging and meaningful conversation about the history of science fiction art.</p></p><h2>The Origins of the First World War (2nd Edition)</h2><p><p>James Joll's justly-celebrated and best-selling study is not simply another narrative, retracing the powder trail that was finally ignited at Sarajevo.

Crafting an engrossing journey from the gushing Pennsylvania oil fields of the 1860s to today's fraught and fractious Middle East, <i>Crude Volatility</i> explains how past periods of stability and volatility in oil prices help us understand the new boom-bust era. Oil's notorious volatility has always been considered a scourge afflicting not only the oil industry but also the broader economy and geopolitical landscape; Robert McNally makes sense of how oil became so central to our world and why it is subject to such extreme price fluctuations.<br><br>Tracing a history marked by conflict, intrigue, and extreme uncertainty, McNally shows how&#x2015;even from the oil industry's first years&#x2015;wild and harmful price volatility prompted industry leaders and officials to undertake extraordinary efforts to stabilize oil prices by controlling production. Herculean market interventions&#x2015;first, by Rockefeller's Standard Oil, then, by U.S. state regulators in partnership with major international oil companies, and, finally, by OPEC&#x2015;succeeded to varying degrees in taming the beast. McNally, a veteran oil market and policy expert, explains the consequences of the ebbing of OPEC's power, debunking myths and offering recommendations&#x2015;including mistakes to avoid&#x2015;as we confront the unwelcome return of boom and bust oil prices.</p><p>Robert McNally is the founder and president of The Rapidan Group, a leading energy consulting firm, and a nonresident fellow at the Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy. From 2001 to 2003, he served as the top international and domestic energy adviser on the White House staff.Robert McNally has written an excellent biography of a world-famous character, known for volatility and violent mood swings, sometimes reviled but always a player in the world economy and politics&#x2015;the oil price. Insightful and timely, <i>Crude Volatility</i> explores the clash over many decades between "boom and bust" prices and the efforts to harness them. In the current market, McNally explains why volatility is likely to win out over stability&#x2015;highly significant for what will remain the world's most important commodity for many years to come.

(Scott Sheffield, CEO, Pioneer Natural Resources)<br><br>This is an important book. Bob McNally is the first to place shale oil in its proper historical context and explain the ramifications. His conclusions have profound implications for policymakers and the market. It would be unwise to venture out into this new and more volatile oil market without using McNally as your guide. (Paul Horsnell, Global Head of Commodities at Standard Chartered)<br><br>This completely fresh viewpoint from Robert McNally is a must read for anyone involved in the oil market. The historical perspective provided in <i>Crude Volatility</i> is critical to understanding the future of prices and the impact they will have on the geopolitical order in years to come. Buckle up for a wild ride! (Paul Tudor Jones, founder of Tudor Investment Corporation and the Robin Hood Foundation)<br><br>Splendid... McNally is both a skillful historian and an astute analyst... for readers who do not have the time to tackle Daniel Yergin's 900-page standard-bearer, <i>The Prize </i>(1990), <i>Crude Volatility</i> is a concise alternative for understanding the grand narrative of oil. (R. Tyler Priest <i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>[McNally] deftly explains the motivation behind attempts to temper oil market swings. . . .

The five other stories in this collection are tales of quiet tension and raw intensity. From the local color of small-town life to the bustle of the city to war stories imbued with an ironic view of heroism, these stories are brilliantly constructed, extraordinarily lyrical, and psychologically penetrating.

Published in 1893, when the author was just twenty-one, it broke new ground with its vivid characters, its brutal naturalism, and its empathic rendering of the lives of the poor.

Today it continues to figure prominently in world news as a focal point for tales of the infamous traffic in opium and heroin. Yet this fascinating area is also of considerable interest for a different reason: within it live six culturally distinct people--the Karen, Hmong, Mien, Lahu, Akha and Lisu--struggling in a hostile environment to maintain the integrity of their beliefs, customs, and way of life against all the pressures of the rapidly changing society around them. Paul and Elaine Lewis lived and worked with the tribes of Northern Thailand for many years. The results of their experience and research have been gathered in this book, along with more than 700 photographs--almost all of them in color. Here we see not merely the demanding landscape in which these peoples live, but their ceremonies and rituals, their clothing and ornamentation, their houses and villages and the impressive skills which they exhibit in such crafts as jewelry, textiles, and basketmaking.Paul and Elaine Lewis have lived and worked among tribal people (primarily Lahu and Akha) since 1947--first in Kengtung State, Burma, until 1966 and since 1968 in northern Thailand. They are missionaries of the Board of International Ministries of the American Baptist Churches, and have studied linguistics and anthropology. While working with tribal groups in the areas of literature production, primary health care, family planning, education and craft marketing, they have observed and studied the cultures of the Karen, Hmong, Mien, Lahu, Akha and Lisu.</p><h2>The Jealousy Cure: Learn to Trust, Overcome Possessiveness, and Save Your Relationship</h2><p><p><b>"<i>The Jealousy Cure</i> unlocks the positive power of jealousy for happy relationships."</b><br><b>&#x2014;<i>Foreword Reviews</i><br><br> "Solid counsel for those whose relationships are plagued by jealousy and the individuals it targets."<br> &#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i> starred review</b><br><br><b>Could jealousy be a positive thing?

Robert Leahy, a well-known psychologist&nbsp;and author, offers keys to using jealousy to build relationships, not tear them down.&nbsp;Rather than denying jealousy or condemning it, this book views jealousy as a signal that a relationship is important&nbsp;and requires investment.

It&nbsp;shows that the path to healing starts inside and moves outward, beginning with the individual and not completed&nbsp;without communication and cooperation as a couple. ...&nbsp;Leahy&#x2019;s tone is positive and empowering but far from Pollyannaish. He tackles the toughest relationship hurdles,&nbsp;including infidelity, and affirms difficult feelings and circumstances without brushing them aside.

Leahy, through interactive, fun exercises, helps the reader identify and understand their jealousy. Based on the tried-and-true principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), Leahy then equips the reader to address their jealousy so that problematic behaviors and tormenting thoughts and feelings can be reduced. This highly informative and valuable resource will be an essential resource to both those in clinical practice and individuals struggling with jealously.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Leslie Sokol, PhD</b>, coauthor of <i>Think Confident, Be Confident</i>;<i> Think Confident, Be Confident for Teens</i>; and <i>The Think Confident, Be Confident Workbook for Teens</i> (Leslie Sokol, PhD)<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have a jealousy problem? Does it interfere with your relationship? Are you consumed with jealous thoughts and jealous feelings? Do you wish you could decrease your suffering? If so, you need this book! Robert Leahy clearly expresses why we feel jealous, he normalizes this intense experience, and he explains how our emotions and our thinking get highjacked. Then he details what to do. He teaches the reader how to detach from jealous thoughts and disengage from unhelpful behavior. He offers tools for coping with jealousy and various strategies to solve problems that it causes in relationships. <i>The Jealousy Cure</i> will help individuals who suffer from jealousy and those who are in relationships with jealous partners. As a stand-alone book or an accompaniment to therapy, <i>The Jealousy Cure </i>is very well written and quite interesting (even if you don&#x2019;t have a jealousy problem). Most of all, it provides essential skills for couples who need to improve their relationships.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Judith S.

Warlike, exuberant, and superstitious, they saw divinities in every facet of life and nature, venerating deities of the sun, thunder, water, war, healing, hunting, fertility, and death. They practiced human and animal sacrifice, and a powerful priesthood--the Druids--presided over much of their religious life. <i>The Dictionary of Celtic Myth and Legend covers every aspect of Celtic myth, religion, and folklore in Britain and Europe between 500 BC and AD 400. In parallel with the fruits of archaeological research, the testimony of Classical writers and the earliest recorded versions of the pagan oral traditions of Wales and Ireland provide us with a complete overview of Celtic lore. This guide presents that knowledge in over 400 copiously illustrated articles, together with a comprehensive historical introduction.</i></p><p>Miranda Green is the author of several books on ancient beliefs, including <i>The World of the Druids</i> (Thames and Hudson).This well-written, attractively orga nized work encompasses Celtic myth, religion, and legend that can be "evidenced by archaeology and literature." Green, author of several books on an cient beliefs and cultures (e.g., The Gods of the Celts , Barnes &amp; Noble Bks., 1986; Symbol of Image in Celtic Religious Art , Routledge, 1989), has accumulated a vast amount of material about the fascinating Celtic people during the period 500 B.C.-400 A.D. and she presents this information in a clear and interesting style. The main body of the work is preceded by a "Reader's Guide," a lengthy introduction, and a subject index. Articles, rarely longer than two full columns, are heavily cross-referenced. Major sources are cited and a full bibliography is included. Very well done and recommended for academic and larger public librar ies. BOMC selection.<br><i>- Pamela A.

Ann Swidler's <i>Talk of Love</i> is an attempt to discover how people find and sustain real love in the midst of that talk, and how that culture of love shapes their expectations and behavior in the process. To this end, Swidler conducted extensive interviews with Middle Americans and wound up offering us something more than an insightful exploration of love: <i>Talk of Love</i> is also a compelling study of how much culture affects even the most personal of our everyday experiences.<br></p></p><p><b>Ann Swidler</b> is a professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. She is the author of <i>Organization without Authority</i> and coauthor of <i>Habits of the Heart</i>, <i>The Good Society</i>, and <i>Inequality by Design</i>.Using conversational interviews with 88 white, middle-class, mostly middle-aged suburbanites from the San Jose area in 1980-1981, California sociology professor Swidler attempts to determine how people use cultural meanings in their everyday lives. While this is an extremely narrow group from which to draw any general conclusions, Swidler characterizes them as "not so much `typical' as `prototypical' Americans," who represent not what meanings their culture gives them, but how they apply those meanings. Perhaps anticipating critics who might question the contemporary value of remarks made 20 years ago, Swidler questionably asserts that all people from all times and places use cultural messages in the same ways, regardless of how those messages might vary in content. Among her insights are that "happy" people in "settled" times avoid examining cultural meanings or challenging them even if they don't actually believe them. Conversely, in "unsettled" times (adolescence, divorce, political unrest), people question the culture more actively, Swidler contends, to search for answers or solutions to issues, problems or unhappiness. Though this volume may appeal to a trade audience, it reads like a textbook, with citations within the text that interrupt the flow of the narrative. Unlike authors such as Deborah Tannen, who have made sociological concepts accessible and appealing to mainstream audiences, Swidler offers a dry, scholarly view of what might otherwise have been a fascinating topic. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Kabbalah Of The Golden Dawn (Llewellyn&#39;s Golden Dawn)</h2><p>How the ancient and mystic wisdom of the Kabbalah impacts on the Order of the Golden Dawn is the focus of this inter-disciplinary book.

He then devotes the main portion of the chapter to an exposition of the book, interacting with major commentaries and recent studies.

While taking advantage of the most recent scholarship on the Psalms and the wisdom writings, Estes is able to distill this information and present it in a form that is accessible to laypersons and helpful to any involved in the serious study of Scripture.

Cummings's long-unavailable, yet pointed and moving story of a journey through Soviet Russia.</strong></p> Unavailable for more than fifty years, <em>EIMI</em> finally returns. While sometimes termed a "novel," it is better described as a novelistic travelogue, the diary of a trip to Russia in the 1930s during the rise of the Stalinist government. Despite some contempt for what he witnesses, Cummings's narrator has an effective, occasionally hilarious way of evoking feelings of accord and understanding. As Ezra Pound wrote, Cummings's Soviet Union is laid "out there pellucidly on the page in all its Slavic unfinishedness, in all of its Dostoievskian slobberyness....Does any man wish to know about Russia? 'EIMI'!" <p>A stylistic tour de force, <em>EIMI</em> is a m�lange of styles and tones, the prose containing many abbreviations, grammatical and syntactical shifts, typographical devices, compounds, and word coinages. This is Cummings's invigorating and unique voice at its finest, and <em>EIMI</em> is without question one of his most substantial accomplishments.</p></p><p><p><strong>E. E. Cummings</strong> (1894&#x2013;1962) was among the most influential, widely read, and revered modernist poets. He was also a playwright, a painter, and a writer of prose. Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he studied at Harvard University and, during World War I, served with an ambulance corps in France. He spent three months in a French detention camp and subsequently wrote <em>The Enormous Room</em>, a highly acclaimed criticism of World War I. After the war, Cummings returned to the States and published his first collection of poetry, <em>Tulips &amp; Chimneys</em>, which was characterized by his innovative style: pushing the boundaries of language and form while discussing love, nature, and war with sensuousness and glee. He spent the rest of his life painting, writing poetry, and enjoying widespread popularity and success.</p><p><b>Norman Friedman</b> is an emeritus professor of English at Queens College.</p><p><strong>Madison Smartt Bell</strong> is the author of seventeen novels, his most recent being <em>Behind the Moon</em>.

Since most magnolias are highly ornamental their garden use is a primary focus of the book, though every aspect of magnolias from history to hybridizing is treated.</p><p>Dorothy J. Callaway was born in Alabama and grew up in Bishop, Georgia. She was exposed to natural history (plant science in particular) at an early age through her parents. She attended the University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, and received a B.S. in horticulture, followed by an M.S. in botany from the L. H. Bailey Hortorium at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. Her thesis research involved the taxonomic study of magnolias cultivated in North America. Since then she has written a number of articles on magnolias for major botanical and horticultural journals. Her aims in writing this book are to compile scattered information into a single reference and to introduce others to the fascinating variety of the genus. Dorothy Callaway has served as the official registrar for magnolia cultivars and as a member of the board of trustees of the Magnolia Society, Inc.<br>&#34;The World of Magnolias, a 260 page hardcover from Timber Press documents the magnolia&#39;s history, culture, propagation, and breeding. In addition to many gorgeous full-color photos, the book provides an encyclopedic listing of more than 80 magnolia species. This is a dandy reference for gardeners. If you lack a good work on magnolias, find a place for Callaway&#39;s book on your reference shelf. It is a tremendous accomplishment. It is a publication that magnolia enthusiasts will be very grateful for. This is the most comprehensive book on magnolias available and is a must for every magnolia lover. -- Stephen Pategas &#34;Ornamental Outlook&#34; (06/11/2003) The book is not only a reference compendium on magnolias but a wonderfully readable book on the subject. -- Larrie Sweet &#34;Lafayette Advertiser&#34; (02/06/1995) This book of international relevance makes a worthy reference for anyone interested in trees and shrubs. -- John T.

Spongberg &#34;Plantsman&#34; (12/01/1995) &#34;The World of Magnolias&#34; is not only a work to stimulate the modern breeder and gardener but also a stunning luxurious contribution to pay a tridute to these top-prized landscape plants. -- Jaroslav Durkovic &#34;Forest Genetics&#34; (03/21/1999) &#34;The World of Magnolias,&#34; a 260 page hardcover from Timber Press documents the magnolia&#39;s history, culture, propagation, and breeding.

The purpose of this gathering was to exhibit and criticize the work of five architects--Eisenman, Graves, Gwathmey, Hejduk, and Meier--who constituted a New York school, and who are now among the most influential architects working today.<br> The buildings shown here have more diversity than one might expect from a school, but share certain properties of form, scale, and treatment of material. Collectively, their work makes a modest claim: it is only architecture, not the salvation of man and the redemption of the earth. No matter how varied their individual theories and visions, all five architects simply share a passion for the art of architecture.<br> Providing complete drawings and photographic documentation, this collection also includes a comparative critique by Kenneth Frampton, an Introduction by Colin Rowe that suggests a still broader context for the work as a whole, and two short texts in which individual positions are outlined. Now back in print, <em>Five Architects</em> serves as a reference to the early work of some of America's most important architects and provides us with a glimpse back at the direction of architecture as they saw it twenty years ago.</p><p><br><em>About the Authors:</em><br> <strong>Peter Eisenman</strong> is founder of both Eisenman Architects and the Institute of Architecture and Urban Studies in New York.

Set on the dirt-poor Aegean island of Skiathos, it is the story of Hadoula, an old woman living on the margins of society and at the outer limits of respectability. Hadoula knows about herbs and their hidden properties, and women come to her when they need help. She knows women&#x2019;s secrets and she knows the misery of their lives, and as the book begins, she is trying to stop her new-born granddaughter from crying so that her daughter can at last get a little sleep. She rocks the baby and rocks her and then the terrible truth hits her: there&#x2019;s nothing worse than being born a woman, and there&#x2019;s something that she, Hadoula, can do about that.<br><br>Peter Levi&#x2019;s matchless translation of Alexandros Papadiamantis&#x2019;s astonishing novella captures the excitement and haunting poetry of the original Greek.</p><p>Alexandros Papadiamantis (1851&#x2013;1911) was born and raised on the Aegean island of Skiathos, the setting not only of <i>The Murderess</i> but of many of his short stories, literary sketches, and novels. His mother was a descendent of an established local family and his father was a Greek Orthodox priest. As a young man, Papadiamantis spent seven months in a monastery and studied philosophy at the University of Athens before taking up a career as a journalist and translator. He enjoyed popular success as the author of historical adventure novels like <i>The Gypsy Girl </i>(1884), which were serialized in daily newspapers, but it was not until he turned to writing short stories and novellas that he gained critical recognition. Though a heavy drinker and smoker, Papadiamantis was devout, poor, and solitary, known as the saint of modern Greek literature. He lived in Athens rooming houses until 1908, when he returned to Skiathos. Two years later, he died of pneumonia. <br><br>Peter Levi (1931&#x2013;2000) was a poet, translator, novelist, and professor of classics at Oxford.

He wrote more than twenty volumes of poetry, and from 1984 to 1989 held the chair of Professor of Poetry at Oxford.Text: English, Greek (translation)</p><h2>Van Dyck, Rembrandt, and the Portrait Print</h2><p>In the last decade of his life, Anthony van Dyck (1599&#x2013;1641) undertook a printmaking project that changed the conventions of portraiture. In a series later named&nbsp;the&nbsp;<i>Iconography</i>, he portrayed artists alongside kings, courtiers, and diplomats&#x2014;a radical departure from preexisting conventions. He also depicted his subjects in novel ways, focusing on their facial features often to the exclusion of symbolic costumes or props. In addition to illustrating approximately&nbsp;60 works by Van Dyck and other artists from his era&#x2014;particularly Rembrandt&#x2014;this catalogue traces the artist&#x2019;s influence over hundreds of years.

He describes how Rabin, a former general who led the army in the Six-Day War of 1967, embraced his nemesis, Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, and set about trying to resolve the twentieth century&#x2019;s most vexing conflict. He recounts in agonizing detail how extremists on both sides undermined the peace process with ghastly violence. And he reconstructs the relentless scheming of Amir, a twenty-five-year-old law student and Jewish extremist who believed that Rabin&#x2019;s peace effort amounted to a betrayal of Israel and the Jewish people. As Amir stalked Rabin over many months, the agency charged with safeguarding the Israeli leader missed key clues, overlooked intelligence reports, and then failed to protect him at the critical moment, exactly twenty years ago. It was the biggest security blunder in the agency&#x2019;s history.</p><p>Through the prism of the assassination, much about Israel today comes into focus, from the paralysis in peacemaking to the fraught relationship between current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Barack Obama. Based on Israeli police reports, interviews, confessions, and the cooperation of both Rabin&#x2019;s and Amir&#x2019;s families, <em>Killing a King</em> is a tightly coiled narrative that reaches an inevitable, shattering conclusion. One can&#x2019;t help but wonder what Israel would look like today had Rabin lived.</p> 16 pages of illustrations</p><p>An award-winning writer, Dan Ephron has served as the Jerusalem bureau chief for Newsweek and the Daily Beast and now lives in New York City.&#x201c;An illuminating version of the story...admirably concise and meticulously reported.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>A.

This a journal describing his feelings on the rediscovery of the New York of his childhood, and the growth of modern commercial America. He muses on Thoreau, Hawthorne and Emerson; in Washington, he finds a cityscape devoid of spiritual symbols; in Richmond, thoughts of the civil war haunt him. Published in 1907, this journal also served as a farewell address to the country James would never live in again.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>To be an American is, as Henry James famously observed, a "complex fate." But complexity was that rococo master's stock-in-trade, which may explain why he returned to his native country in 1904 after an absence of more than 20 years. To be sure, he was interested in a Jamesian walk down memory lane, with its full quota of meditative hairsplitting. Yet he also meant to take advantage of his hybrid status as a Europeanized American. "I made no scruple," James explains in his introduction, "of my conviction that I should understand and should care better and more than the most earnest of visitors, and yet that I should vibrate with more curiosity ... than the pilgrim with the longest list of questions." Vibrate he did, in the ornate and extraordinary periods of his late phase, and the result was a one-of-a-kind travel book, <i>The American Scene</i>.<p> James opens his book with an impressionistic overture, which can be slightly off-putting: he seems too intent on leaping beyond the dry <i>donn�e</i> of American life into pure abstraction. But readers shouldn't be discouraged. Even in the opening pages the author manages some brilliant snapshots, like this description of New Hampshire's Saco River: "The rich, full lapse of the river, the perfect brownness, clear and deep, as of liquid agate, in its wide swirl, the large indifferent ease in its pace and motion, as of some great benevolent institution smoothly working; all this, with the sense of the deepening autumn about, gave I scarce know what pastoral nobleness to the scene, something raising it out of the reach of even the most restless of analysts." And once James begins his journey proper up and down the Eastern seaboard, he delivers one amazing page after another. He doesn't, of course, care for everything he sees--the skyscrapers of Manhattan strike him as vertical monstrosities, and he lets loose with more than one politically incorrect shaft at the minority population.</p><p> What appalls him the most, though, is the Almighty Dollar, which he perceives as "the preliminary American postulate," the very bedrock of New World life: "This basis is that of active pecuniary gain and of active pecuniary gain only--that of one's making the conditions so triumphantly pay that the prices, the manners, the other inconveniences, take their place as a friction it is comparatively easy to salve, wounds directly treatable with the wash of gold." Some will argue that the fussbudget author had spent too much time in England, where <i>money</i> remained a dirty word until after the Second World War. Others may find his diagnosis eerily prescient. In any case, <i>The American Scene</i> remains required reading for anybody interested in U.S. history, Henry James, or the incredible evolution of the compound sentence. <i>--James Marcus</i></p><b>Henry James</b> (1843-1916), born in New York City, was the son of noted religious philosopher Henry James, Sr., and brother of eminent psychologist and philosopher William James.

He lived in Newport, went briefly to Harvard Law School, and in 1864 began to contribute both criticism and tales to magazines.<p>In 1869, and then in 1872-74, he paid visits to Europe and began his first novel, <b>Roderick Hudson</b>.

But <i>The Education of Henry Adams</i> is surely one of the few masterpieces to issue directly from a raging inferiority complex. The author, to be sure, had bigger shoes to fill than most of us. Both his grandfather and great-grandfather were U.S. presidents. His father, a relative underachiever, scraped by as a member of Congress and ambassador to the Court of St. James. But young Henry, born in Boston in 1838, was destined for a walk-on role in his nation's history--and seemed alarmingly aware of the fact from the time he was an adolescent.<p> It gets worse. For the author could neither match his exalted ancestors nor dismiss them as dusty relics--he was an Adams, after all, formed from the same 18th-century clay. "The atmosphere of education in which he lived was colonial," we are told, </p><blockquote>revolutionary, almost Cromwellian, as though he were steeped, from his greatest grandmother's birth, in the odor of political crime. Resistance to something was the law of New England nature; the boy looked out on the world with the instinct of resistance; for numberless generations his predecessors had viewed the world chiefly as a thing to be reformed, filled with evil forces to be abolished, and they saw no reason to suppose that they had wholly succeeded in the abolition; the duty was unchanged.</blockquote> Here, as always, Adams tells his story in a third-person voice that can seem almost extraplanetary in its detachment. Yet there's also an undercurrent of melancholy and amusement--and wonder at the specific details of what was already a lost world.<p> Continuing his uphill conquest of the learning curve, Adams attended Harvard, which didn't do much for him. ("The chief wonder of education is that it does not ruin everybody concerned in it, teachers and taught.") Then, after a beer-and-sausage-scented spell as a graduate student in Berlin, he followed his father to Washington, D.C., in 1860. There he might have remained--bogged down in "the same rude colony ... camped in the same forest, with the same unfinished Greek temples for workrooms, and sloughs for roads"--had not the Civil War sent Adams <i>p�re et fils</i> to London. Henry sat on the sidelines throughout the conflict, serving as his father's private secretary and anxiously negotiating the minefields of English society. He then returned home and commenced a long career as a journalist, historian, novelist, and peripheral participant in the political process--a kind of mouthpiece for what remained of the New England conscience.</p><p> He was not, by any measure but his own, a failure. And the proof of the pudding is <i>The Education of Henry Adams</i> itself, which remains among the oddest and most enlightening books in American literature. It contains thousands of memorable one-liners about politics, morality, culture, and transatlantic relations: "The American mind exasperated the European as a buzz-saw might exasperate a pine forest." There are astonishing glimpses of the high and mighty: "He saw a long, awkward figure; a plain, ploughed face; a mind, absent in part, and in part evidently worried by white kid gloves; features that expressed neither self-satisfaction nor any other familiar Americanism..." (That would be Abraham Lincoln; the "melancholy function" his Inaugural Ball.) But most of all, Adams's book is a brilliant account of how his own sensibility came to be. A literary landmark from the moment it first appeared, the <i>Autobiography</i> confers upon its author precisely that prize he felt had always eluded him: success. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>'I cannot remember when I was not fascinated by Henry Adams, ' said Gore Vidal. 'He was remarkably prescient about the coming horrors.' <br>His political ideals shaped by two presidential ancestors--great-grandfather John Adams and grandfather John Quincy Adams--Henry Adams was one of the most powerful and original minds to confront the American scene from the Civil War to the First World War. <br>Printed privately in 1907 and published to wide acclaim shortly after the author&amp;'s death in 1918, The Education of Henry Adams is a brilliant, idiosyncratic blend of autobiography and history that charts the great transformation in American life during the so-called Gilded Age. <br>With an introduction by renowned historian Edmund Morris.</p><h2>Betty Crocker Christmas Cookbook</h2><p><b>The spectacular all-in-one guide to Christmas cooking, decorating, and entertaining</b><p>Perfect for all kinds of Christmas inspiration, <i>Betty Crocker Christmas Cookbook</i> gives you everything you need to make the holiday sparkle-tasty recipes, entertaining essentials, decorating tips, and creative gift-giving ideas.

He shows how their respective projects are best understood as engaging in a variety of ways with some of the core themes and issues associated with high modernism, and indeed with its prehistory in French painting and art criticism from Diderot on. <i>Four Honest Outlaws</i> thus continues the author's exploration of the critical and philosophical territory opened up by his earlier book, the magisterial <i>Why Photography Matters as Art as Never Before</i>. It presents a vision of the most important contemporary art as not only not repudiating modernism in the name of postmodernism in any of the latter's many forms and manifestations, but also actually as committed to dialectically renewing certain crucial qualities and values that modernism and premodernism brought to the fore, above all those of presentness and anti-theatricality. </p><p><i>Four Honest Outlaws</i> takes its title from a line in a Bob Dylan song, "To live outside the law you must be honest," meaning in this case that each of the four artists has found his own unsanctioned path to extraordinary accomplishment, in part by defying the ordinary norms and expectations of the contemporary art world. Filled with stunning images throughout and accompanied by a DVD illustrating works by Sala and Gordon discussed in its pages, <i>Four Honest Outlaws</i> is sure to provoke controversy even as it makes a dramatic bid to further transform the terms in which the art of the present should be understood.</p></p><p><p><b>Michael Fried</b> is J. R. Herbert Boone Professor of Humanities and the History of Art, Johns Hopkins University. His many books of art criticism, art history, literary criticism, and poetry include <i>Absorption and Theatricality</i>; <i>Realism, Writing, Disfiguration</i>; <i>Courbet's Realism</i>; and <i>Art and Objecthood</i>.</p>"Fried's style is sprightly and displays an unquenchable curiosity that makes him seem&#x2014;in the best possible way&#x2014;more like a tour guide than the author of a 245-page work of criticism. Though his theories can be controversial, the fact that he heartily opens himself up to disagreement shows that he, a true modernist, practices what he preaches."&#x2014;Sarah E.

He did more than anyone in his era to combat the rising threat of fascism in Britain during World War II, in spite of his own history inside this movement. He was also truly eccentric--a thrice-married jazz aficionado who kept a menagerie of exotic pets--and almost totally unqualified for espionage.<br>Yet he had a gift for turning practically anyone into a fearless secret agent. Knight's work revolutionized British intelligence, pioneering the use of female agents, among other accomplishments. In telling Knight's remarkable story, <i>Agent M</i> also reveals for the first time in print the names and stories of some of the men and women recruited by Knight, on behalf of MI5, who were asked to infiltrate the country's most dangerous political organizations.<br>Drawing on a vast array of original sources, <i>Agent M</i> reveals not only the story of one of the world's greatest intelligence operators, but the sacrifices and courage required to confront fascism during a nation's darkest time.</p><p><b>Henry Hemming </b>is the author of five previous works of nonfiction, including most recently <i>The Ingenious Mr. Pyke</i>. He has written for the <i>Economist, FT Magazine</i>, and the <i>Washington Post</i>, and his books have been featured in the <i>New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Christian Science Monitor</i>, and other places. He lives in London with his wife and daughter.<b>"</b>The dramatic story of the remarkable British spymaster...Many spy stories are page-turners, but [Henry Hemming] proves that the story of one man can be equally thrilling. Hemming has uncovered a man determined not to be known and in so doing, has provided us with delightful reading."<br><br> <b>-Kirkus Reviews</b><br><br> "Espionage writing at its best." <br><br> -<b>Charles Cumming, author of <i>A Divided Spy</i></b><br><br> "Crammed with cracking stories and founded on sound research, Henry Hemming's biography of Maxwell Knight-'M'-stands comparison with the bestselling books of Ben Macintyre." <br><br>-<b>Adam Sisman, author of <i>John Le Carr�</i></b><br><br> "I raced through Henry Hemming's book, constantly having to remind myself that it wasn't a work of fiction. It really has everything you'd want from a great espionage story: incredible agents risking their lives; the highest possible stakes, with the safety of the world hanging in the balance; and at its heart a complicated, mercurial spy master in Maxwell Knight spinning an ever more intricate web." <br><br>-<b>Matt Charman, Oscar-nominated screenwriter of <i>Bridge of Spies</i></b><br><br> "Absolute proof that assiduous digging in the archives can produce scoops. This is intelligence research at its best, especially in the identification of hitherto anonymous agents. Definitely a great contribution to the literature."<br><br>- <b>Nigel West, author of <i>MI5</i></b><br><br>"This in-depth introduction illuminates a largely forgotten man of antidemocratic tendencies who played a key role in keeping Britain secure and democratic for much of the interwar and early postwar periods."&#x2015;<b><i>Publishers Weekly<br></i></b></p><h2>Bilingual: Life and Reality</h2><p>Whether in family life, social interactions, or business negotiations, half the people in the world speak more than one language every day. Yet many myths persist about bilingualism and bilinguals. In a lively and entertaining book, an international authority on bilingualism explores the many facets of life with two or more languages.</p><p>Fran�ois Grosjean is Professor Emeritus at the Universit� de Neuch�tel.Grosjean (<i>Life with Two Languages</i>) breaks little new ground in his study of bilingualism, but he does succeed in his stated aim to demystify who bilinguals are and the psychological ramifications of possessing more than one language with which to process and articulate experience. His discussion zeros in on such behaviors as suppressing the knowledge of one language in order to communicate in another or the choice to resist using a language because of a trauma or, conversely, lack of emotional connection to it. He distinguishes between bilinguals and biculturals and the situations that arise in the case of their coincidence. While not quite a revelation on the ability or aptitude for bilingualism, the book is a clear and readable primer covering various linguistic idiosyncrasies, state attitudes toward bilingualism, how to encourage equal aptitude in both languages, and the challenges in raising bilingual children. Enlivening the text are Grosjean's anecdotes about growing up bilingual (he is the son of an English mother and French father) and studies on the intersection of language and politics&#x2014;especially when bilingualism is explicitly nurtured, as in Navajo revival classes on reservations. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A brief Biographical Sketch of Fyodor Dostoyevsky follows at the end.</p><p>Fyodor Dostoyevsly Biographical Sketch <p>November 11, 1821, born in Moscow, son of a staff doctor at a charity hospital. 1838, entered army engineering college in St Petersburg (Leningrad). Did not like this training, read much literature. 1839 -June, his father was murdered by his own serfs, who had been brutally mistreated. 1844-October, gave his army commission to finish first novel, Poor Folk, in April 1845. Praise by the critic Belinski brought immediate success. 1849, his participation in a revolutionary group was punished by four years in a Siberian prison. 1850s, epilepsy developed. 1854 to 1858, stayed on in Siberia. Wrote "Uncle's Dream' and "Friend of the Family" while there. 1857 - February, first marriage a failure. 1859, returned to St Petersburg. Published a monthly periodical called Time. 1866, Crime and Punishment put Dostoyevsky in the front rank of Russian writers. 1867 -February, three years after his first wife's death, Dostoyevsky married a young stenographer, who proved to be a good manager of his finances. Of their four children, two died very early. 1868-69, almost unnoticed by Russian critics, Dostoyevsky's novel The Idiot is one of the most discerning and powerful. Published in a period of revolutionary agitation, its universal theme - a good man in human society - was not considered timely. 1874-75, the reception of The Adolescent (or A Raw Youth) was unfriendly. 1879-80, his genius was immediately seen in his last and greatest novel The Brothers Karamazov. 1870's in Dostoyevsky's last years, revolutionary activity in Russia was increasing, with attempts on the life of the Czar and high state officials. He became very conservative, edited a conservative weekly, and felt that Russia and the Orthodox Church alone were fated to lead Europe and the world from evil to the good. February 9, 1881, died in St Petersburg.</p>The Legend of the Grand Inquisitor This "prose poem" from The Brothers Karamazov is probably the climax of Dostoyevsky's religious confessions. It is recited by Ivan Karamazov, who refused to recognize God although he admits God's existence. <p>"He came softly, unobserved, and yet, strange to say, everyone recognized Him. The people are irresistibly drawn to Him, they surround Him, they flock about Him, follow Him. He moves silently in their midst with a gentlesmile of infinite compassion. The sun of love burns in His heart; light and power shine from His eyes; and their radiance, shed on the people, stirs their hearts with responsive love. He holds out His hands to them and blesses them and a healing virtue comes from contact with him, even with His garments. An old man in the crowd, blind from childhood, cries out, 'O Lord, heal me and I shall see Thee!' and as it were, scales fall from his eyes and the blind man sees Him. The people weep and kiss the earth under His feet. Children throw flowers before Him, sing, and cry hosannah. 'It is He - it is He!' all repeat. 'It must be He, it can be no none but He!' He stops at the steps of the Seville cathedral at the moment when the weeping mourners are bringing in a! ! little open white coffin. In it lies a child of seven, the only daughter of a prominent citizen. The dead child lies hidden in flowers. 'He will raise your child,' the crowd shouts to the weeping mother. The priest, coming to meet the coffin, looks perplexed and frowns, but the mother of the dead child throws herself at His feet with a wail. 'If it is You, raise my child!' she cries, holding out her hands to Him. The procession halts, the coffin is laid on the steps at His feet. He looks with compassion, and his lips once more softly pronounce, 'Talitha cumi!' and the maiden arises The little girl sits up in the coffin and looks round, smiling with wide-open eyes, holding white roses they had put in her hand. </p><p>"There are cries, sobs, confusion among the people, and at that moment the cardinal himself, the Grand Inquisitor, passes by the cathedral. He is an old man, almost ninety, tall and erect, with a withered face and sunken eyes, in which there is still a gleam of light. He is not dressed in his gorgeous cardinal's robes, as he was the day before, when he was burning the enemies of the Roman Church - at this moment he is wearing his coarse, old monk's cassock. At a distance behind him come his gloomy assistants and slaves and the 'holy guard.' He stops at the sight of the crowd and watches it from a distance. He sees everything; he sees them set the coffin down at His feet, sees the child rise up, and his face darkens. He knits his thick gray brows and his eyes gleam with a sinister fire. He holds out his finger and bids the guards take Him. And such is his power, so completely are the people cowed into submission and trembling obedience to him, that the crowd immediately ma! ! ke way for the guards, and in the midst of deathlike silence they lay hands on Him and lead Him away. The crowd, like one man, instantly bows down to the earth before the old inquisitor. He blesses the people in silence and passes on. The guard lead their prisoner to the close, gloomy vaulted prison in the ancient palace of the Holy Inquisition and shut Him in it. The day passes and is followed by the dark, burning, breathless night of Seville. The air is fragrant with laurel and lemon. In the pitch darkness the iron door of the prison is suddenly opened and the Grand Inquisitor himself comes in with light in his hand. He is alone; the door is closed at once behind him. He stands in the doorway and for a minute or two gazes in His face. At last he goes up slowly, sets the light on the table and speaks. </p><p>"Is it You? You?' but receiving no answer, he adds at once, 'Don't answer, be silent. What can You say, indeed? I know too well what You would say. And You have no right to add anything to what You have said of old. Why then, are You come to hinder us? For You have come to hinder us, and You know that. But You know what will be tomorrow? I know not who You are and care not to know whether it is You or only a semblance of Him, but tomorrow I shall condemn You and burn You at the stake as the worst of heretics. And the very people who have kissed Your feet, tomorrow at the faintest sign from me will rush to heap up the embers of Your fire. Know you that? Yes, maybe You know it,' he added with thoughtful penetration, never for a moment taking his eyes off the Prisoner."</p></p><h2>Doctor Faustus</h2><p><p> <em>Doctor Faustus</em> is a classic; its imaginative boldness and vertiginous ironies have fascinated readers and playgoers alike. But the fact that this play exists in two early versions, printed in 1604 and 1616, has posed formidable problems for critics. How much of either version was written by Marlowe, and which is the more authentic? Is the play orthodox or radically interrogative? </p> <p> Michael Keefer&#x2019;s early work helped to establish the current consensus that the 1604 text was censored and revised; the Keefer edition, praised for its lucid introduction and scholarship, was the first to restore two displaced scenes to their correct place. Most competing editions presume that the 1604 text was printed from authorial manuscript, and that the 1616 text is of little substantive value. But in 2006 Keefer&#x2019;s fresh analysis of the evidence showed that the 1604 quarto&#x2019;s Marlovian scenes were printed from a corrupted manuscript, and that the 1616 quarto (though indeed censored and revised) preserves some readings earlier than those of the 1604 text. </p> <p> This edition has been updated and revised. Keefer&#x2019;s critical introduction reconstructs the ideological contexts that shaped and deformed the play, and the text is accompanied by textual and explanatory notes and excerpts from sources. </p></p><p>This is a full cast production with sound effects and original music produced at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre. <p>Length is approximately 2 hours.</p><p> <strong>Michael Keefer</strong> is a Professor of English at the University of Guelph, former President of the Association of Canadian College and University Teachers of English, and winner of the Renaissance Society of America&#x2019;s Nelson Prize. He has published widely on English Renaissance literature, early modern philosophy, literary and textual-critical theory, and contemporary cultural politics. </p></p><h2>The Really Short Poems of A. R. Ammons</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Filled with sharp irony and passionate insight, the more than 100 poems in the collection span the career of one of the deans of contemporary poetry. . . . Ammons makes you laugh and forces you to think hard about the way humans relate to natural phenomena and to themselves. From such simple, short expression emerge complex, often confounding ideas. New readers of poetry as well as those with an active interest in lyric verse will love this volume.&#x201d;&#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></strong></p></p><p>These short pieces frequently combine the discipline and precision of haiku with the assured and humorous tone of cracker-barrel philosophy. Ammons, who has been known to have plenty to say, cuts to the heart of the matter in poem after poem, suggesting worlds of unspoken wisdom and humor. &#34;Success Story&#34; is a good example of the project, as Ammons explains why he never &#34;got on good&#34; with the rest of the world: &#34;First I had nothing / the world wanted / then the world had / nothing I wanted.&#34;A. R. Ammons&#x2019;s (1926&#x2013;2001) was a two-time winner of the National Book Award and the recipient of a National Book Critics Circle Award. His many additional honors include the Academy of American Poets&#x2019; Wallace Stevens Award, the Bollingen Prize, the Poetry Society of America&#x2019;s Robert Frost Medal, the Ruth Lilly Prize, and fellowships from the Guggenheim and MacArthur Foundations.</p><h2>Does Technology Drive History? The Dilemma of Technological Determinism</h2><p><p><b>These thirteen essays explore a crucial historical questionthat has been notoriously hard to pin down: To what extent,and by what means, does a society's technology determine itspolitical, social, economic, and cultural forms?</b></p><p>These thirteen essays explore a crucial historical question that has been notoriously hard to pin down: To what extent, and by what means, does a society's technology determine its political, social, economic, and cultural forms? Karl Marx launched the modern debate on determinism with his provocative remark that "the hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill, society with the industrial capitalist," and a classic article by Robert Heilbroner (reprinted here) renewed the debate within the context of the history of technology. This book clarifies the debate and carries it forward.Marx's position has become embedded in our culture, in the form of constant reminders as to how our fast-changing technologies will alter our lives. Yet historians who have looked closely at where technologies really come from generally support the proposition that technologies are not autonomous but are social products, susceptible to democratic controls. The issue is crucial for democratic theory. These essays tackle it head-on, offering a deep look at all the shadings of determinism and assessing determinist models in a wide variety of historical contexts.</p><p><b>Contributors<br></b>Bruce Bimber, Richard W.

Thus did Harriet Beecher Stowe announce her decision to begin work on what would become one of the most influential novels ever written. The subject she had hesitated to "meddle with" was slavery, and the novel, of course, was <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>. Still debated today for its portrayal of African Americans and its unresolved place in the literary canon, Stowe's best-known work was first published in weekly installments from June 5, 1851 to April 1, 1852. It caused such a stir in both the North and South, and even in Great Britain, that when Stowe met President Lincoln in 1862 he is said to have greeted her with the words, "So you are the little woman who wrote the book that created this great war!"<br> In this landmark book, the first full-scale biography of Harriet Beecher Stowe in over fifty years, Joan D. Hedrick tells the absorbing story of this gifted, complex, and contradictory woman. Hedrick takes readers into the multilayered world of nineteenth century morals and mores, exploring the influence of then-popular ideas of "true womanhood" on Stowe's upbringing as a member of the outspoken Beecher clan, and her eventful life as a writer and shaper of public opinion who was also a mother of seven. It offers a lively record of the flourishing parlor societies that launched and sustained Stowe throughout the 44 years of her career, and the harsh physical realities that governed so many women's lives. The epidemics, high infant mortality, and often disastrous medical practices of the day are portrayed in moving detail, against the backdrop of western expansion, and the great social upheaval accompanying the abolitionist movement and the entry of women into public life.<br> Here are Stowe's public triumphs, both before and after the Civil War, and the private tragedies that included the death of her adored eighteen month old son, the drowning of another son, and the alcohol and morphine addictions of two of her other children. The daughter, sister, and wife of prominent ministers, Stowe channeled her anguish and her ambition into a socially acceptable anger on behalf of others, transforming her private experience into powerful narratives that moved a nation.<br> Magisterial in its breadth and rich in detail, this definitive portrait explores the full measure of Harriet Beecher Stowe's life, and her contribution to American literature. Perceptive and engaging, it illuminates the career of a major writer during the transition of literature from an amatuer pastime to a profession, and offers a fascinating look at the pains, pleasures, and accomplishments of women's lives in the last century.</p><p>Harriet Beecher Stowe, daughter of a preacher, married to a poor Biblical scholar, and mother of nine, had the early good fortune of an education at a school founded by her feminist older sister. To help support her family, Stowe began to write. In 1851, born of evangelical outrage against slavery, her novel Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin made her famous. Today the very name conveys white paternalism and black passivity, but Hedrick points out that this unfairly ignores the &#34;freedom narrative&#34; of a book that had an electrifying effect on the abolitionist cause. When Abraham Lincoln met Stowe in 1862 he joked, &#34;So you&#39;re the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war.&#34; Hedrick&#39;s illuminating biography of this remarkable woman won the 1995 Pulitzer Prize.<br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Joan D.

No other series of study and solution guides has come close to the Problem Solvers in usefulness, quality, and effectiveness. Educators consider the Problem Solvers the most effective series of study aids on the market. Students regard them as most helpful for their school work and studies. With these books, students do not merely memorize the subject matter, they really get to understand it. Each Problem Solver is over 1,000 pages, yet each saves hours of time in studying and finding solutions to problems. These solutions are worked out in step-by-step detail, thoroughly and clearly. Each book is fully indexed for locating specific problems rapidly. Exceptionally useful for all persons taking courses in this field. The subject matter is thoroughly developed, beginning with basic probability and extending through binomial, normal, joint, discrete, and continuous distributions. Other sections deal with sampling, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, regression, and correlation analysis. An extensive number of applications are included.<br></p><p>HOW TO USE THIS BOOK<br><br> This book can be an invaluable aid to statistics students as a supplement to their textbooks. The book is divided into 24 chapters, each dealing with a separate topic. The subject matter is developed beginning with basic probability and extending through binomial, normal, joint, discrete, and continuous distributions. Other sections deal with sampling and sampling theory, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, regression and correlation analysis, analysis of variance, and non-parametric methods. An extensive number of illustrated problems involving statistics applications have been included, since these appear to be most troublesome to students. <br><br>HOW TO LEARN AND UNDERSTAND<br>A TOPIC THOROUGHLY<br><br> 1. Refer to your class text and read the section pertaining to the topic. You should become acquainted with the principles discussed there. These principles, however, may not be clear to you at the time.<br><br> 2. Locate the topic you are looking for by referring to the "Table of Contents" in the front of this book. <br><br> 3. Turn to the page where the topic begins and review the problems under each topic, in the order given. For each topic, the problems are arranged in order of complexity, from the simplest to the more difficult. Some problems may appear similar to others, but each problem has been selected to illustrate a different point or solution method.<br> <br> To learn and understand a topic thoroughly and retain its contents, it will be generally necessary for students to review the problems several times. Repeated review is essential in order to gain experience in recognizing the principles that should be applied, and to select the best solution technique. <br>HOW TO FIND A PARTICULAR PROBLEM<br><br> To locate one or more problems related to particular subject matter, refer to the index. In using the index, be certain to note that the numbers given there refer to problem numbers, not to page numbers. This arrangement of the index is intended to facilitate finding a problem more rapidly, since two or more problems may appear on a page.<br><br> If a particular type of problem cannot be found readily, it is recommended that the student refer to the "Table of Contents," and then turn to the chapter which is applicable to the problem being sought. By scanning or glancing at the material that is boxed, it will generally be possible to find problems related to the one being sought, without consuming considerable time. After the problems have been located, the solutions can be reviewed and studied in detail.<br><br> For the purpose of locating problems rapidly, students should<br>acquaint themselves with the organization of the book as found in the "Table of Contents."<br><br> In preparing for an exam, it is useful to find the topics to be covered in the exam from the "Table of Contents," and then review the problems under those topics several times. This should equip the student with what might be needed for the exam. <br><br></p><h2>The New Cultural History (Volume 6) (Studies on the History of Society and Culture)</h2><p>Across the humanities and the social sciences, disciplinary boundaries have come into question as scholars have acknowledged their common preoccupations with cultural phenomena ranging from rituals and ceremonies to texts and discourse. Literary critics, for example, have turned to history for a deepening of their notion of cultural products; some of them now read historical documents in the same way that they previously read "great" texts. Anthropologists have turned to the history of their own discipline in order to better understand the ways in which disciplinary authority was constructed. As historians have begun to participate in this ferment, they have moved away from their earlier focus on social theoretical models of historical development toward concepts taken from cultural anthropology and literary criticism.<br><br>Much of the most exciting work in history recently has been affiliated with this wide-ranging effort to write history that is essentially a history of culture. The essays presented here provide an introduction to this movement within the discipline of history. The essays in Part One trace the influence of important models for the new cultural history, models ranging from the pathbreaking work of the French cultural critic Michel Foucault and the American anthropologist Clifford Geertz to the imaginative efforts of such contemporary historians as Natalie Davis and E. P. Thompson, as well as the more controversial theories of Hayden White and Dominick LaCapra. The essays in Part Two are exemplary of the most challenging and fruitful new work of historians in this genre, with topics as diverse as parades in 19th-century America, 16th-century Spanish texts, English medical writing, and the visual practices implied in Italian Renaissance frescoes. Beneath this diversity, however, it is possible to see the commonalities of the new cultural history as it takes shape. Students, teachers, and general readers interested in the future of history will find these essays stimulating and provocative.</p><p>"An important and provocative argument for the 'new cultural history, ' an approach to history that stresses the importance of meaning in social action and the complexity of recovering the dynamics of expression and interpretation in the past."--Michael MacDonald, University of Wisconsin, Madison<p>"An extremely important work that explains what is meant by 'the new cultural history.' It successfully explores the central ideas of this line of research, and it shows how this growing new field relates to developments in such other disciplines as anthropology. The book is uncommonly readable."--Elvin Hatch, University of California, Santa Barbara</p><p>"A lively and timely guide to a body of theory, some of it notoriously difficult, that is currently shaping academic practice."--Jan Goldstein, University of Chicago</p><b>Lynn Hunt</b> is Professor of History at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><h2>Pasajes: Cultura</h2><p>The <b><i>Pasajes</i></b> series is one of the most widely used and highly respected programs for intermediate Spanish courses in North America. As in previous editions, the seventh edition of <i>Pasajes</i> consists of three volumes, all coordinated by theme, chapter by chapter: a review of grammar (<i>Lengua</i>), a cultural reader <i>Cultura</i>), and a literary reader (<i>Literatura</i>). The result is a very flexible program that can be used in any combination and thus is easily adapted to suit the needs of a wide variety of instructors and intermediate courses. The new edition offers a new film feature in <i>Lengua</i> with pre- and post-viewing questios and an accompanying image.

This lyrical yet practical-minded book is at once a record of the 26 months Thoreau spent in withdrawal from society -- an account of the daily minutiae of building, planting, hunting, cooking, and, always, observing nature -- and a declaration of independence from the oppressive mores of the world he left behind.

Through the text&#39;s prominent focus on invention, you will learn to recognize the rhetorical elements of any argumentative situation and apply the tools of argument effectively in your own writing. The basic layers of argument are introduced in early chapters, with material arranged into increasingly sophisticated topics beginning with the most obvious or explicit layers (claims) and moving to more implied or &#34;hidden&#34; layers (assumptions, values, beliefs, ideology). By the time you finish Part I, you will have a thorough understanding of argument, which you can then apply not just to the invention projects in Chapters 7?12, but also to your writing for other college courses and beyond.</p><p>John Mauk has a Ph.D. in rhetoric and writing from Bowling Green State University and a Masters in language and literature from the University of Toledo.

The first nine steps of the program modify the approach presented in Russell A. Barkley's DEFIANT CHILDREN, SECOND EDITION, to focus on developmental concerns of adolescence. The authors delineate clear procedures for assessing defiance in teens and working with parents, alone or in groups, to reverse problem behavior. Steps 10 through 18 are conducted with parents and teenagers together, utilizing a proven family therapy model developed by Arthur L. Robin and Sharon Foster. Clinicians are shown how to help all family members learn to negotiate, communicate, and problem-solve more effectively, while facilitating adolescents' individuation and autonomy. Featuring a lay-flat binding for ease of photocopying, the book includes reproducible forms that enable clinicians to gauge the nature, diversity, and severity of parent/n-/adolescent conflicts; assess for oppositional defiant disorder (ODD); and evaluate parental psychological adjustment. Reproducible handouts for families reinforce crucial ideas and skills imparted in-session. <br></p><p>Of Related Interest- <p><i>Defiant Children: A Clinician's Manual for Assessment and Parent Training, Second Edition</i>, Russell A.

Posing the question, "What does it mean to show?" Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett explores the agency of display in a variety of settings: museums, festivals, world's fairs, historical re-creations, memorials, and tourist attractions. She talks about how objects&#x2015;and people&#x2015;are made to "perform" their meaning for us by the very fact of being collected and exhibited, and about how specific techniques of display, not just the things shown, convey powerful messages.<br><br> Her engaging analysis shows how museums compete with tourism in the production of "heritage." To make themselves profitable, museums are marketing themselves as tourist attractions. To make locations into destinations, tourism is staging the world as a museum of itself. Both promise to deliver heritage. Although heritage is marketed as something old, she argues that heritage is actually a new mode of cultural production that gives a second life to dying ways of life, economies, and places. The book concludes with a lively commentary on the "good taste/bad taste" debate in the ephemeral "museum of the life world," where everyone is a curator of sorts and the process of converting life into heritage begins.</p><p>"<i>Destination Culture</i> is a book of discovery. Reading it is to accompany Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett through fairs and museums, as a tourist and as an always sharp observer of people. The power of this book is to show how first-rate ethnographic work is also the stuff of cultural studies.

Focusing on the important, yet often-overlooked, role that photography played in Homer&#x2019;s art, this volume exposes Homer&#x2019;s own experiments with the camera (he first bought one in 1882). It also explores how the medium of photography and the larger visual economy influenced his work as a painter, watercolorist, and printmaker at a moment when new print technologies inundated the public with images. Frank Goodyear and Dana Byrd demonstrate that photography offered Homer new ways of seeing and representing the world, from his early commercial engravings sourced from contemporary photographs to the complex relationship between his late-career paintings of life in the Bahamas, Florida, and Cuba and the emergent trend of tourist photography. The authors argue that Homer&#x2019;s understanding of the camera&#x2019;s ability to create an image that is simultaneously accurate and capable of deception was vitally important to his artistic practice in all media. Richly illustrated and full of exciting new discoveries, <i>Winslow Homer and the Camera </i>is a long-overdue examination of the ways in which photography shaped the vision of one of America&#x2019;s most original painters.</p><p>This groundbreaking study of Winslow Homer&#x2019;s engagement with photography examines both the artist&#x2019;s own photographic practice and photography&#x2019;s influence on his work across media.<p><b>Dana E. Byrd</b> is assistant professor of art history at Bowdoin College. <b>Frank H.

Walls</h2><p>Through the work of Andrew Walls, an introduction to the paradigm shift that recognizes the dynamic reality of Christianity s emergence as a world religion. <br><br>Recent years have seen a paradigm shift in Christian self-understanding. In place of the eurocentric model of Christendom, a new understanding has emerged of Christianity as a world movement. At the cornerstone of this new perspective lies the work of a remarkable scholar, Andrew F. Walls, whose book, The Missionary Movement in Christian History (Orbis 1996) was named by Christianity Today as one of the hundred most influential books of the twentieth century. Understanding World Christianity introduces the Walls s work and explores its wide-ranging implications for the understanding of history, mission, the formative place of Africa in the Christian story, and the cross-cultural transmission of faith. <br><br>Contributors include: Kwame Bediako; I.

In addition to providing a review of fundamental statistical methods, it provides a basic treatment of advanced computer-based multivariate analytical techniques; including correlation and regression analysis, analysis of variance, discriminant analysis, factor analysis, cluster analysis, and multidimensional scaling. The conceptual treatment emphasizes the rationales, applications, and interpretations, rather than the theoretical mathematical aspects of the most commonly used data analysis techniques in use today, closing the gap between spiraling technology and its intelligent application, providing students and researchers with a decided advantage in their future studies and careers. <p>Its conceptual non-mathematical approach is especially helpful to students, researchers, and managers in the social and health sciences, education, and business. It is also the ideal springboard for those who will pursue advanced study of these powerful multivariate techniques.</p></p><p>Sam Kash Kachigan is the author of several innovative books in mathematics and psychology, including &#34;Multivariate Statistical Analysis,&#34; &#34;Statistical Analysis,&#34; &#34;The Sexual Matrix,&#34; &#34;The Game,&#34; and &#34;Over 100 Traits of Truly Horrible People.&#34; His books have been used in graduate programs at over 300 leading universities, in over a dozen different academic disciplines. He is also a prolific photographer and experimental filmmaker. As such, he is one of very few individuals to have made significant contributions to both the arts and sciences. He was born in Wisconsin of immigrant Armenian parents, and received his inter-disciplinary education at the University of Wisconsin, The University of Washington, and Columbia University.Preface to the First Edition <p>This book is intended as an introduction to multivariate statistical analysis for individuals with a minimal mathematics background. </p><p>The presentation is conceptual in nature with emphasis on the rationales, applications, and interpretations of the most commonly used multivariate techniques, rather than on their mathematical, computational, and theoretical aspects. As such, the book is intended primarily not for the I reader in 100 who will go on to specialize in statistical analysis, but for the other 99 who will only obtain an overview of the subject, yet will have to deal in their professional lives with the design, analysis, and interpretation of research by interfacing with specialists in the field. </p><p>Although a prior course in elementary statistics would be beneficial, it is not absolutely essential, since the fundamentals are thoroughly reviewed in the first two chapters. Consequently, the book can be used either as an introductory or intermediate level text, and will also find use as a reference volume for those already in the professional community. </p><p>Since the principles of statistical analysis are perfectly general, cutting across all academic disciplines, students in all curriculums can use the text. This is especially true since much of the book is devoted to the discussion of concepts and principles rather than to specific examples. The illustrations that are used are drawn from three major areas-monetary disciplines, including business, economics, and government; behavioral disciplines, including education, psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, and communications; and organic disciplines, including biology, medicine, and agriculture. Students of the physical sciences and engineering are advised to take a mathematical statistics course where they can capitalize on their backgrounds in calculus and matrix algebra, although such students can also benefit from the present approach. </p><p>I am grateful to the Literary Executor of the late Sir Ronald A. Fisher, F.R.S., to Dr. Frank Yates, F.R.S. and to Longman Group Ltd. .London, for permission to use Tables II, III, and IV from their book Statistical Tables for Biological, Agricultural and Medical Research (6th edition, 1974). I am also thankful to the dozens of individuals who made helpful comments at various stages of the manuscript. While many of the suggestions were heeded, I accept responsibility for any shortcomings that remain. </p><p>S.K.K. New York, New York October, 1981 </p><p>Preface to the Second Edition </p><p>Aside from some minor textual changes, the main difference of this book from the initial 1982 edition is the addition of a chapter on Multidimensional Scaling. This chapter is taken from my 1986 textbook "Statistical Analysis: An Interdisciplinary Introduction to Univariate and Multivariate Methods," which is a more full-scale text, containing all the material in this edition plus a more thorough coverage of univariate, experimental design, multiple comparisons, time series, and probability topics, as well as providing student exercises. </p><p>Another new feature of this edition is its availability as an economical paperback. For many instructors the 1986 Statistical Analysis text - which is twice the length of this book - is too comprehensive for their particular curriculum needs, despite their desire to cover multivariate methods in an introductory manner. Consequently, this paperback edition will afford instructors greater flexibility in the design of their courses. </p><p>Not only will this edition serve as a basic introductory course in multivariate methods for the many students who do not have extensive mathematical backgrounds, but it will also complement those multivariate texts which are often too technical to fully benefit all the students enrolled in such courses. </p><p>Moreover, the conceptual approach of this book should prove to be a valuable guide for both graduate and undergraduate introductory courses, providing an integrated overview of the most useful analytical techniques that students are bound to encounter in their future studies and research activities. </p><p>S.K.K.

Their depiction of the lives of ordinary men and women in a provincial Midlands town initiated a new era of nineteenth-century literary realism. The tales concern rural members of the clergy and the gossip and factions that a small town generates around them. Amos Barton only realizes how much he depends upon his wife's selfless love when she dies prematurely; Mr Gilfil's devotion to a girl who loves another is only fleetingly rewarded; and Janet Dempster suffers years of domestic abuse before the influence of an Evangelical minister turns her life around. <br><br>These stories are remarkable for the tenderness with which Eliot portrays a bygone time of religious belief in a newly secular age, giving literary fiction an alternative language to religion and philosophy for the observation and understanding of human experience.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong><br>For over 100 years <em>Oxford World's Classics</em> has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe.

BUILD YOUR LIFE AROUND IT.</strong></p><p>In an age of distraction, everyone is looking for something that gives purpose and perspective on life. Jesus says it's the kingdom of God. But the kingdom is not just another religious idea.

Seek First brings theology to the streets, giving a vision for the kingdom that will truly change your life.</p><p>"Treat presents the message of the kingdom in a way that gives us a grander vision for life, whether in the workplace or on the basketball court." - <strong>CHRIS BROUSSARD</strong>, NBA analyst and sports broadcaster</p><p>"Few books do as good a job as this one in showing us how giving up everything for Christ and his kingdom is the pathway to our greatest gain.

He is the award-winning author of <em>The Crucified King: Atonement and Kingdom in Biblical and Systematic Theology.</em></p>It's one of life's disorienting paradoxes: some of the most tormented souls are also some of the most successful. Long-term joy, fulfill- ment, and human flourishing can never be found in constructing our own kingdoms. So where is true joy and renewal found? In winsome ways, my friend Jeremy Treat shows us, by reminding us of another paradox. Yet this one is far more beautiful and ful- filling: it is when we put down our own kingdoms and seek first God's kingdom.&nbsp;Seek First&nbsp;is an inspiring reminder to keep first things first. -&nbsp;Bryan Loritts,&nbsp;author,&nbsp;Insider Outsider<br><br>To explain something important, you usually must choose between being incisively passionate or comprehensively balanced.

Gresham Machen Professor of Theology, Westminster Seminary California<br><br>With the theological vision of&nbsp;The Crucified King, it became clear Jeremy Treat is a first-rate theologian of the Word. In&nbsp;Seek First&nbsp;we see the fruit of years putting that vision to work at the heart of Los Angeles as a pastor-theologian of the church. With clear prose, careful theological and biblical exposition, vivid illustration, and relevant application, Jeremy invites regular Christians to focus on the one thing that really matters: the kingdom of God. Wide-ranging and surprisingly comprehensive,&nbsp;Seek First&nbsp;gives us an integrative vision of what it means to embrace, experience, and seek the kingdom of God in our everyday lives of work, play, service, and worship. Most importantly, he does this in every chapter by fixing our eyes firmly on the person and work of King Jesus, who is the kingdom in his very person. I really hope folks get their hands on this book. -&nbsp;Derek Rishmawy,&nbsp;PhD student at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, columnist for&nbsp;Christianity Today,&nbsp;and cohost of the&nbsp;Mere Fidelity&nbsp;podcast<br><br>Seek First&nbsp;is a work of love that is biblically solid and globally informed. The kingdom is not provincial but universal. Christian theology, therefore, ought to reflect the diversity of God's royal family. That is certainly the case for this book by Jeremy Treat. It is rooted in a particular social location and yet engages with global, theological, multiethnic voices simultaneously. It is a delightful experience to learn new names from around the world. Healthy family conversation with diverse past and present Christian the- ologies truly enriches the kingdom-of-God narrative.

Terry Eagleton's book, in this vital new series from Blackwell, focuses on discriminating different meanings of culture, as a way of introducing to the general reader the contemporary debates around it.<br> <p>In what amounts to a major statement, with pointed relevance to the world in the new millennium, Eagleton launches a critique of postmodern "culturalism", arguing instead for a more complex relation between Culture and Nature, and trying to retrieve the importance of such concepts as human nature from a non-naturalistic perspective. His book sets its face against a certain fashionable populism in this area, as well as drawing attention to the deficiencies of elitism. It makes radical inquiry into the reasons, both creditable and discreditable, why 'culture' has come in our own period to bulk as large as it does, and provocatively proposes that it is time, while acknowledging its significance, to put it back in its place.</p></p><h2>Ships and Shipwrecks of the Americas: A History Based on Underwater Archaeology</h2><p>Tells the development of watercraft in the Americas and Canada, drawing on the work of undersea archaeologists to recount every phase of American naval history, from Native American cultures to the destruction of the Arizona at Pearl Harbor</p><p>Ships and Shipwrecks of the Americas brings together for the first time the remarkable work of leading nautical archaeologists, each with firs-hand diving experience.

Hirsch, along with practically every state government "raising the bar" and toughening standards, in this attack on the back-to-basics movement. An established critic of America's fixation on grades and test scores, Kohn has written a detailed, methodical treatise that accuses politicians and educators of replacing John Dewey, the father of public education, with test-tutoring king Stanley Kaplan. The current standards movement that demands students learn a list of dates and facts prepares kids for <i>Jeopardy</i>, Kohn argues, not real life. He joins David C. Berliner and Bruce J. Biddle (<i>The Manufactured Crisis</i>) in questioning whether today's schools are truly floundering, warning that romantic memories of the old school, with its tests, worksheets, and drills, are purely that--memories romanticized by time and perception.<p> Kohn backs up his argument with research and observations from like-minded reformers such as Deborah Meier, but his position is nothing new. Rather, it is a volley back at traditionalists, a direct counter to Hirsch's 1996 book <i>The Schools We Need</i>, which Kohn critically dissects at length, even accusing Hirsch of incorrectly generalizing footnoted research. Kohn also takes issue with the backlash against the whole-language approach to reading instruction (though this argument wears thin, given that many schools have already moved beyond the debate to use a combination of whole language and phonics). The overall message of <i>The Schools Our Children Deserve</i> is a valid cautionary tale about the future of American education that deserves to be heard out by teachers, policymakers, and parents. <i>--Jodi Mailander Farrell</i></p>Are our schools in trouble because they have lowered their standards and strayed too far from the basics? Just the opposite, says Alfie Kohn: if American students are getting less than they deserve, it's due to simplistic demands to "raise the bar" and an aggressive nostalgia for traditional teaching. <p>Alfie Kohn, the author of critically acclaimed works on such subjects as competition and rewards, now turns the conventional wisdom about education on its head. In this landmark book, he shows how the "back to basics" philosophy of teaching treats children as passive receptacles into which forgettable facts are poured. Likewise, shrill calls for Tougher Standards are responsible for squeezing the intellectual life out of classrooms. Such politicized slogans reflect a lack of understanding about how and why kids learn, and they force teachers to spend time preparing students for standardized tests instead of helping them to become critical, creative thinkers. </p><p>Kohn has an ambitious yet practical vision of what our children's classrooms could be like. Drawing on a remarkable body of research, he helps parents and others interested in education understand the need to move beyond a "bunch o' facts" model of teaching. Using stories from real classrooms, he shows how this can be done. Along the way, he offers surprising insights about the Whole Language-versus-phonics controversy, why a straight-A report card may not be good news, and how we can best gauge the progress of schools and students. </p><p><i>The Schools Our Children Deserve</i> presents a fresh perspective on today's headlines about education--and on what our children will be asked to do in class tomorrow morning. It is a persuasive invitation to rethink our most basic assumptions about schooling.</p></p><h2>Conflict, War, and Peace: An Introduction to Scientific Research</h2><p>Introducing students to the scientific study of peace and war, <em><strong>Conflict, War, and Peace: An Introduction to Scientific Research</strong></em>, edited by Sara McLaughlin Mitchell and John A.

Abstracting colonization, war, immigration, disease, and first-language loss until only sparse phrases remain, Kim takes on the anguish and displacement of those whose lives are embedded in history.<br><br>Kim's blank spaces are loaded silences: openings through which readers enter the text and find their way. These silences reveal gaps in memory and articulate experiences that will not translate into language at all. Her words retrieve the past in much the same way the human mind does: an image sparks another image, a scent, the sound of bombs, or conversation. These silences and pauses give the poems their structure.<br><br><i>Commons'</i>s fragmented lyric pushes the reader to question the construction of the poem. Identity surfaces, sinks back, then rises again. On this shifting ground, Kim creates meaning through juxtaposed fragments. Her verse, with its stops and starts, its austere yet rich images, offers splinters of testimony and objection. It negotiates a constantly changing world, scavenging through scraps of experience, spaces around words, and remnants of emotion for a language that enfolds the enormity of what we cannot express.</p><p>"The poems in Commons are at once global and intensely personal and emotional. An immensely talented poet, Myung Mi Kim loves language - its internal rhymes, alliterations, and diverse rhythms. Caught off guard by the beauty and precision of Kim's language and the exquisite images she so deftly conjures, we are drawn unwittingly into a web of fragmentary memories that subvert what we think we know about the violent history that haunts her and never ceases to demand recognition."&#x2015;Elaine Kim, author of <i>Asian American Literature: An Introduction to the Writings and Their Social Context,</i> and co-editor of <i>Dangerous Women: Gender and Korean Nationalism</i><b>Myung Mi Kim </b>is Professor of Creative Writing at San Francisco State University.

It is designed to help them develop a Christ-centered focus early in life and find their way through society&#x2019;s confusing swirl of gray. Using illustrations from his experience in flying airplanes, Gary points youth to timeless foundational biblical truth. The many stories capture the reader&#x2019;s attention, and young people will find it engaging reading.</p><p><b>Gary Miller</b> has had a growing passion to help Christians use their personal finances to build God&#x2019;s Kingdom. He also works with the poor in Third World countries and started an experimental microloan program in Haiti. As part of this program, Gary wrote a teaching manual designed to provide both spiritual and financial teaching. After Christian Aid Ministries took over this microloan program (SALT Microfinance Solutions), they recognized that the Scriptural principles in Gary&#x2019;s manual were just as pertinent for our American Anabaptist communities, and asked him to write this book. Gary was raised in an Anabaptist community in California and lives with his wife Patty and family in the Pacific Northwest. He worked in construction all his life, but now focuses his time and energy on writing and helping find sustainable solutions for the poor.<br>Far more than a book on finances, <i>Charting A Course</i> will help youth establish a life plan that channels their time, talents, and resources into the Kingdom of God.<br> Gary Miller addresses practical issues such as credit, advertising pressure, and our infatuation with electronic gadgets, offering down-to-earth, easy-to-follow guidance. And he does so within the framework of Jesus' call to seek first the Kingdom of God.

As their populations ballooned during the Industrial Revolution, North American and European powers came to depend on this unique resource as well, helping them meet their ever-increasing farming needs. This book explores how the production and commodification of guano has shaped the modern Pacific Basin and the world&#39;s relationship to the region. Marrying traditional methods of historical analysis with a broad interdisciplinary approach, Gregory T. Cushman casts this once little-known commodity as an engine of Western industrialization, offering new insight into uniquely modern developments such as environmental consciousness and conservation movements; the ascendance of science, technology, and expertise; international relations; and world war.</p><p>This book provides a global history of guano, a once little known but vastly important commodity that originates in the Pacific Basin.

For the fifty years since his death on September 8, 1949, Richard Strauss has remained dogmatically elusive in the wider body of musical and historical criticism. Lauded as nothing less than the &#34;greatest musical figure&#34; of his time by Canadian musician, Glenn Gould, in 1962, Strauss also has attracted his share of posthumous epithets: in summary, an artist who lived off his own fat during his later years. As recently as 1995, the English critic Rodney Milnes wrote, &#34;the court of posterity is still reserving judgment.&#34; In Richard Strauss: Man, Musician, Enigma, biographer Michael Kennedy demonstrates that the many varying shades of criticism that have painted this figure in the past half century resemble the similar understandings and misunderstandings held by his contemporaries--perceptions that touched almost every aspect of Strauss&#39; life and career. Introducing his detailed work more as a broad explication than a firm answer to the Straussian riddle, Kennedy&#39;s scope includes the exuberant, extroverted Strauss of young adulthood as well as the phlegmatic and aloof middle-aged man who resembled a &#34;prosperous bank manager;&#34; the arch-fiend of modernism and the composer who redefined the term; a man who professed to lack all spiritual curiosity and a musician who penned the touching ballet Der Kometentanz; an at times almost humble family man and an artist who claimed to be as interesting as Napoleon and Alexander the Great. Kennedy clearly elucidates his enigmatic subject by building his analysis around the few constants in Strauss&#39; life: his profound admiration for German culture, his dependence on his own family for guidance, and his &#34;Nietzschean total absorption in art.&#34; This frame offers everyone from Straussian scholars to general readers an insightful and easy-to-follow biographical narrative. Kennedy also deals at length with Strauss&#39; problematic relationship with Nazi authorities, detailing his incompatible roles as the father-in-law of a Jewish woman and as one of the country&#39;s leading composers. Michael Kennedy is the chief music critic of the (London) Sunday Telegraph and the author of many books about music.</p><p>There are few composers whose critical stock has roller-coastered as dramatically as that of Richard Strauss, both during his lifetime and in the five decades since his death in 1949. Once considered a dangerous firebrand of the avant-garde--his early masterpiece <i>Salome</i> was given the equivalent of an X rating--Strauss remained an exceedingly prolific composer throughout his long career, yet lived to be "written off as an extinct volcano." The painful story of his involvement with the Third Reich further cast a pall over his final years. But in the past two decades, a gradual reassessment has been underway--along with a recuperation of his neglected later works--and the field is ripe for a critically insightful overview of Strauss's achievement.<p> Such is the goal of Michael Kennedy, a longtime advocate of Strauss, in his new biography, <i>Richard Strauss: Man, Musician, Enigma</i>. Kennedy, the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i>'s music critic and author of several other musical biographies--including an earlier study of the composer as well as illuminating articles and CD booklets on his music--here undertakes to penetrate the contradictions and see the man whole. Through his impressive access to diaries, letters, and living relatives, he posits an underlying consistency of attitude that made "art the reality in [Strauss's] life." The central enigma about the composer that fascinates Kennedy is the "disparity between man and musician," the paradox that this fundamentally aloof and reserved person, dedicated to bourgeois stability, could produce music of such overpowering passion. </p><p> While steering clear of Freudian reductionism, Kennedy reveals the crucial significance of Strauss's mother's nervous instability--she was eventually committed to various sanatoriums--and the centrality of the work ethic inherited from his father. The result was to make music "Strauss's means of escape ... and in much of his music he wore a mask." Yet for all his aloofness, Strauss "let [the mask] slip"--another aspect of the enigma surrounding him--in such compositions as <i>Don Quixote</i> ("the most profound" of his orchestral works) or the pervasively autobiographical <i>Sinfonia Domestica</i>, <i>Intermezzo</i>, and <i>Capriccio</i>, which Kennedy counts as Strauss's greatest achievement for the lyrical stage.</p><p> Kennedy is particularly persuasive in his high estimation of the post-<i>Rosenkavalier</i> output and the undiminished quest for artistic innovation that they continued to exemplify--above all in Strauss's development of a fluently conversational style in his operas. Although commentary on individual works involves generally concise summations, many observations sparkle with insight, and Kennedy continually sheds light on neglected gems among Strauss's output. The rapport with Hofmannsthal and his other librettists is admirably clarified, and the remarkably well-read Strauss emerges as a more imposingly intellectual figure, steeped in literature and philosophy, than he is usually depicted. We learn of his obsession with the card game skat and of his disdainful attitude toward the new medium of film. Kennedy similarly demystifies much of the received opinion that has developed around the composer, particularly in his level-headed portrait of his wife, Pauline. The fundamental happiness of their lifelong relationship emerges as a context indispensable to Strauss's creative focus.</p><p> Kennedy devotes a significant portion of the book to the composer's position as president of the Reich Music Chamber and subsequent fall from grace both with the Nazis and in world opinion. Here the author aims to offer perspective by carefully detailing the facts and documentary evidence from the time. In his view, Strauss becomes a "tragic figure, symbolising the struggle to preserve beauty and style in Western European culture" against emerging barbarism. Yet, as throughout the book, Kennedy's abiding sympathy with Strauss at times veers close to a kind of special pleading that invites skepticism. For all that, his style is admirably lucid, and his biography largely succeeds in pointing to a greatness that "has not yet been fully understood and discovered." <i>--Thomas May</i></p>This first detailed biography of Strauss for many years re-assesses the man and his music half a century after his death, drawing on much hitherto ignored material. Kennedy considers fully the period during the Third Reich when Strauss was first feted and then cold-shouldered by the authorities, as well as describing his long, happy but tempestuous marriage. A picture emerges of a level-headed, practical and extremely versatile musician--a great conductor as well as a great composer.</p><h2>Music Theory for the Bass Player: A Comprehensive and Hands-on Guide to Playing with More Confidence and Freedom</h2><p>Note: To ensure to receive the latest version of this book buy from Amazon directly (not an Amazon marketplace seller).Music Theory for the Bass Player is a comprehensive and immediately applicable guide to making you a well-grounded groover, informed bandmate and all-around more creative musician. <b>Included with this book are 89 videos that stream from the author's blog.</b> This is a workbook, so have your bass and a pen ready to fill out the engaging Test Your Understanding questions! <i>This version is revised for typos and to add video flags.</i> Have you always wanted to learn music theory but felt it was too overwhelming a task?

The richness of Mr. Johns's book lies in the splendid detail he has collected to describe the world of books in the first two centuries after the printing press arrived in England."&#x2014;Alberto Manguel, <i>Washington Times</i><br><br>"[A] mammoth and stimulating account of the place of print in the history of knowledge. . . . Johns has written a tremendously learned primer."&#x2014;D. Graham Burnett, <i>New Republic</i><br><br>"A detailed, engrossing, and genuinely eye-opening account of the formative stages of the print culture. . . . This is scholarship at its best."&#x2014;Merle Rubin, <i>Christian Science Monitor</i><br><br>"The most lucid and persuasive account of the new kind of knowledge produced by print. . . . A work to rank alongside McLuhan."&#x2014;John Sutherland, <i>The Independent</i><br><br>"Entertainingly written. . . . The most comprehensive account available . . . well documented and engaging."&#x2014;Ian Maclean, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i></p><p>Weighing in at 750-plus pages, Adrian Johns's sturdy tome is several books in one. At one level, it is a close study of print culture in early modern England, a time of civil war in which social and civic relations were being remade from the mores of feudal monarchy to a politics approximating modern democracy. In this transformation, the printing press was an essential vehicle for empowering the common people, and control over the publishing industry was contested among several parties--the government, authors, booksellers, the printers themselves. At another level, Johns's book is a study of the role of printing in the formation of scientific knowledge, a means whereby scientific discoveries could be widely circulated and codified. At another, it is a contribution to the sociology of communication, concentrating on changes in English society thanks to the press, through which a literate but remarkably isolated people who, an 18th-century writer observed, knew no more of the city and countryside outside their immediate neighborhood than they did of France or Russia, could become aware of the larger world--often over the objections of power-makers like Sir Francis Bacon, who urged that the people not be given access to information that did not immediately concern them. <p> Johns's book is dense with facts and quotations from the contemporary literature, but his prose is lightened by keen observation and telling anecdotes. (In one, Benjamin Franklin tried to make his way across Europe as a journeyman printer but grew so disgusted at the copious drinking of his fellow tradesmen that he switched careers, an accident that would change the course of history.) <i>The Nature of the Book</i> will be especially useful to those now tracking the communications revolution of the late 20th century, in which new technologies are once again changing power relations and supplanting old media. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>By and large, our trust in the veracity of books goes unquestioned, a tacit assumption made possible by virtue of the concerted efforts of writers and printers at the dawn of print culture. Believing that attaining an understanding of this crucial legacy, and the complex nexus of knowledge and print, is key to appreciating many of the subtleties of modern civilization, Johns tracks the evolution of the book by focusing on the book trade as practiced in one hugely influential locale, London. In his exacting and often pioneering narrative, Johns chronicles the complexity of the craft, politics, and economies of printing and book publishing, with profiles of seminal individuals, discussion of the physiology of reading, and penetrating scrutiny of the rather shaky foundations of scientific, philosophical, and historical discourse. There has been a noticeable surge in new research into the history of reading, a line of inquiry inspired, no doubt, by the spread of electronic technology, a communications frontier begging for exactly the sort of rigorous standards that were applied to print four centuries ago. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>An Artist in America 4th Revised Edition (Volume 1)</h2><p><p>Controversial, flamboyant, contentious, brilliant--Thomas Hart Benton (1889-1975) was certainly all of those. Few American artists have stirred so much love and hatred as he did in a career that lasted almost seventy years. Although his painting aroused much controversy, perhaps equally as much was created by his words, for his piercing wit, profane sarcasms, and insightful condemnations were fired off without restraint. In this fiery and provocative autobiography, Benton presents an intriguing records of American art and society during his lifetime.</p><p>The first installment of this work was published in 1937, but Benton continued his life story in chapters added to editions published in 1951 and 1968. This new edition includes seventy-six drawings that add much to his narrative, plus a foreword discussing Benton's place in American art and an afterword covering his career after 1968, both written by art historian Matthew Baigell.</p><p>Although Benton is most famous as a regionalist painter and muralist, his complex and fascinating career brought him into contact with many of the most important artists and thinkers of the century, including Jackson Pollock, Grant Wood, Julian Huxley, Felix Frankfurter, Eugene Debbs, John Reed, and Harry Truman. While living in New York and on Martha's Vineyard in the 1920s and 1930s, Benton often associated with leading intellectuals and radicals. However, when his evolving principles of art led him away from an interest in Marxism, he was bitterly attacked by many of his former friends, and his account of that time reveals strikingly the fierce critical battles he faced in trying to establish his own artistic vision.</p><p>Critics on the Left were not his only opponents, however, and equally revealing are his responses to the moral condemnations heaped on his murals done for the states of Indiana and Missouri and on his realistic nudes of the late 1930s.</p><p>Throughout his account, from descriptions of his boyhood in southwest Missouri, his travels, and his career to discussions of specific works of art and other artists, Benton portrays people and events as vividly in words as he does in his paintings.</p></p><p><p><b>About the Author</b></p><p>Thomas Hart Benton - no notes in the book about the author</p></p><h2>The Pterosaurs: From Deep Time</h2><p><p>Here is the first complete portrait of the legendary flying dragons of deep time&#x2013;the pterosaurs&#x2013;designed for non-specialists, yet founded on the real science of these bizarre creatures.&nbsp; Presented lucidly and accessibly by one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts, David Unwin&#x2019;s book is built on a mountain of new fossil discoveries and the latest research.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>About 220 millions years ago, a group of reptiles took to the Earth&#x2019;s vast and open skies.

He studied at Trinity College, Dublin and Magdalen College, Oxford. He later lived in London and married Constance Lloyd there in 1884. Wilde was a leader of the Aesthetic Movement. His only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, was first published in Lippincott&#39;s Monthly Magazine in 1890. He published a revised and expanded edition in 1891 in response to negative reviews which criticised the book&#39;s immorality. Wilde became famous through of the immense success of his plays such as Lady Windemere&#39;s Fan (1892), An Ideal Husband (1895) and The Importance of Being Earnest (1895). In 1985, after a public scandal involving Wilde&#39;s relationship with Lord Alfred Douglas, he was sentenced to two years&#39; hard labour in Reading Gaol for &#39;gross indecency&#39;. His poem The Ballad of Reading Gaol was based on his experiences in prison and was published in 1898. After his release, Wilde never lived in England again and died in Paris on 30 November 1900. He is buried in Pere Lachaise cemetery.</p><h2>Healthcare Strategic Planning, Third Edition (Ache Management)</h2><p><p>Strategic planning is an important management tool, especially in an era of uncertainty.

The Deerslayer is the culmination of James Fenimore Cooper s Leather-Stocking novels, featuring Natty Bumppo (the deer-slaying young frontiersman) and the Mohican chief, Chingachgook. Cooper portrays the hubris of the conquest of a vast territory. The action takes place during the American wars of the 1740s. Natty and his friend Harry attempt to save a trapper and two young women, whose floating fort on Lake Glimmerglass is besieged by the ruthless Iroquois. The tension steadily increases to the point at which a cruel outcome seems inevitable. The exciting action, the romantic potentialities and the knowledgeable evocation of frontier life (with its moral and racial conflicts) have made this novel a perennial favourite. The courageous Natty, with his problematic values, has set the precedent for countless American heroes. Culturally, The Deerslayer has proved to be a powerfully influential work.</p><p>The deadly crack of a long rifle and the piercing cries of Indians on the warpath shatter the serenity of beautiful lake Glimmerglass. Danger has invaded the vast forests of upper New York State as Deerslayer and his loyal Mohican friend Chingachgook attempt the daring rescue of an Indian maiden imprisoned in a Huron camp. Soon they are caught in the crossfire between a cunning enemy and two white bounty hunters who mercilessly kill for profit. The last of the Leatherstocking tales to be written, though first in the chronology of the hero's life, <i>The Deerslayer</i> is James Fenimore Cooper's masterpiece. A fine combination of romance, adventure, and morality; this classic novel of the frontier is an eloquent beginning for Cooper's great wilderness saga--and an unforgettable introduction to the famous character who has said to embody the conscience of America: the noble woodsman Deerslayer.Set during the French and Indian Wars, The Deerslayer vividly captures the essence of both the murderous humanity and the natural beauty that distinguished America's founding. The last of Cooper's famous Leatherstocking Tales, it is first chronologically in the frontier adventures of the backwoods scout Natty Bumppo. Amid a terrain largely inspired by Cooper's own boyhood, Natty's initiation in the moral codes of wilderness society is examined in what is, according to D. H. Lawrence, "the loveliest and best" of the Leatherstocking series. <br>This Modern Library Paperback Classic is set from the definitive text established by James Franklin Beard and James P. Elliott, which is the Approved Text of the Center for Scholarly Editions of the Modern Language Association.</p><h2>Torture and Democracy</h2><p><p>This is the most comprehensive, and most comprehensively chilling, study of modern torture yet written. Darius Rejali, one of the world's leading experts on torture, takes the reader from the late nineteenth century to the aftermath of Abu Ghraib, from slavery and the electric chair to electrotorture in American inner cities, and from French and British colonial prison cells and the Spanish-American War to the fields of Vietnam, the wars of the Middle East, and the new democracies of Latin America and Europe.</p><br><p> As Rejali traces the development and application of one torture technique after another in these settings, he reaches startling conclusions. As the twentieth century progressed, he argues, democracies not only tortured, but set the international pace for torture. Dictatorships may have tortured more, and more indiscriminately, but the United States, Britain, and France pioneered and exported techniques that have become the lingua franca of modern torture: methods that leave no marks. Under the watchful eyes of reporters and human rights activists, low-level authorities in the world's oldest democracies were the first to learn that to scar a victim was to advertise iniquity and invite scandal. Long before the CIA even existed, police and soldiers turned instead to "clean" techniques, such as torture by electricity, ice, water, noise, drugs, and stress positions. As democracy and human rights spread after World War II, so too did these methods.</p><br><p> Rejali makes this troubling case in fluid, arresting prose and on the basis of unprecedented research--conducted in multiple languages and on several continents--begun years before most of us had ever heard of Osama bin Laden or Abu Ghraib. The author of a major study of Iranian torture, Rejali also tackles the controversial question of whether torture really works, answering the new apologists for torture point by point. A brave and disturbing book, this is the benchmark against which all future studies of modern torture will be measured.</p></p><p><p>"Darius Rejali has written a superb genealogy of modern torture. Meticulously researched and filled with surprising insights, Rejali's indictment derives its power from thoughtful analysis and deep historical grounding. It is the best book on the subject that I have encountered. No one should debate the merits of torture without having read it."<b>--Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch</b></p><p>"Darius Rejali has given the world an extraordinary work of scholarship and personal passion that no one wants to hear about but that everyone must learn about. <i>Torture and Democracy</i> exposes the core issues facing every nation whose deepest values of human dignity are defiled by its state-sanctioned 'violence workers.' Beyond platitudes, this pioneering expert descends into the torture dungeons around the world to reveal the strategies and tactics secretly used to break human will to resist. A vital book for anyone wanting to understand the whys and hows of torture being practiced today by our own government."<b>--Philip Zimbardo, author of <i>The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil</i></b></p><p>"Monumental. Definitive. Devastating."<b>--Sidney Blumenthal</b></p><p>"<i>Torture and Democracy</i> brings the fact of torture straight home to democratic societies--societies that are the most reluctant to acknowledge the presence of torture in their midst. Darius Rejali's theme is the appeal of stealth forms of torture in democracies, but he also illuminates the culture of disinformation, self-deluding euphemisms, and outright mythology that accompanies these kinds of torture. Rejali's research has been truly formidable. He has read more widely in more disciplines than any analyst of torture that I know of."<b>--Edward Peters, author of <i>Torture</i></b></p><p>"This is a timely and extraordinarily important book, an unprecedented study of torture and its technologies, and of the relationship between torture and types of political systems. The research that went into this book is beyond impressive; it is thorough beyond belief. <i>Torture and Democracy</i> will become a reference for anyone who wants to understand torture. Darius Rejali is to be congratulated."<b>--Martha Huggins, Tulane University</b></p><p>"<i>Torture and Democracy</i> is a provocative, state-of-the-art consideration of what Rejali calls 'stealth' or 'clean' torture. He makes a powerful case that democracies tend to be laboratories for these forms of torture and that one of the unintended consequences of democratization is that torture, rather than being eliminated, becomes harder to identify and document."<b>--Austin Sarat, Amherst College</b></p><b>Darius Rejali</b> is professor of political science at Reed College and an internationally recognized expert on modern torture.

This volume represents a major advance in presenting the most important writings about disability with an emphasis on those writers working from a materialist and postmodernist perspective.</p> <p>Drawing together experts in cultural studies, literary criticism, sociology, biology, the visual arts, pedagogy and post-colonial studies, the collection provides a comprehensive approach to the issue of disability. Contributors include Erving Goffman, Susan Sontag, Michelle Fine and Susan Wendell.</p></p><p>"This is an indispensable collection, bringing together foundational arguments in disability studies and provocative new work from emerging young scholars in the field. If you're curious as to why (and how) disability studies has stimulated so much debate in the humanities, <i>The Disability Studies Reader</i> is a great place to start finding out."<br> --Michael B�rub�, Paterno Family Professor in Literature, Penn State University <p>"There is simply no area of contemporary life-- be it medical, economic, educational, juridical, athletic, architectural, culinary, recreation, entertainment--that goes unaddressed in the disability studies literature. Just when you thought that there was nothing new to say about social construction, difference, the performative, the universal, the particular and the body, disability studies comes along to demonstrate both the theoretical and practical urgencies to which these and other too often abstract terms really refer. If you've been hearing about disability studies, but didn't quite know what to make of it, this is the anthology for you." <br> --Stanley Fish, Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor of Humanities and Law, Florida International University </p><p>"A classic just got even better!

With the help of his stepson and partner, John Charles Olmsted, his professional office grew to become the first of its kind: a modern landscape architecture practice with park, subdivision, campus, residential, and other landscape design projects throughout the country.</p><p>During the period covered in this volume, Olmsted and his partners, apprentices, and staff designed the exceptional park system of Boston and Brookline&#x2015;including the Back Bay Fens, Franklin Park, and the Muddy River Improvement. Olmsted also designed parks for New York City, Rochester, Buffalo, and Detroit and created his most significant campus plans for Stanford University and the Lawrenceville School. The grounds of the U.S. Capitol were completed with the addition of the grand marble terraces that he designed as the transition to his surrounding landscape. </p><p>Many of Olmsted&#x2019;s most important private commissions belong to these years. He began his work at Biltmore, the vast estate of George Washington Vanderbilt, and designed Rough Point at Newport, Rhode Island, and several other estates for members of the Vanderbilt family. Olmsted wrote more frequently on the subject of landscape design during these years than in any comparable period. He would never provide a definitive treatise or textbook on landscape architecture, but the articles presented in this volume contain some of his most mature and powerful statements on the practice of landscape architecture.</p></p><p><p>These papers document the personal and professional life of the foremost landscape architect in American history.</p><p><b>Charles E.

It was the first conflict in which airplanes, submarines, and tanks played a significant role and the first in which casualties on the battlefield outnumbered those from disease. It precipitated the collapse of the empires of Austria-Hungary and Turkey, and it promoted revolution in Russia. America's entry into the war and the part it played in the peace settlement signaled the arrival on the world stage of a new great power.<br><br>In this extensively illustrated book, an international team of experts explores the war in all its different aspects. From its causes to its consequences, from the strategy of the politicians to the tactics of the generals, the course of the war is charted, and its political and human consequences assessed.

Yet until now little attention has been paid to the role Reagan's personal spirituality played in his political career, shaping his ideas, bolstering his resolve, and ultimately compelling him to confront the brutal - and, not coincidentally, atheistic - Soviet empire.</p> <p>In this groundbreaking book, political historian Paul Kengor draws upon Reagan's legacy of speeches and correspondence, and the memories of those who knew him well, to reveal a man whose Christian faith remained deep and consistent throughout his more than six decades in public life. Raised in the Disciples of Christ Church by a devout mother with a passionate missionary streak, Reagan embraced the church after reading a Christian novel at the age of eleven. A devoted Sunday-school teacher, he absorbed the church's model of "practical Christianity" and strived to achieve it in every stage of his life.</p> <p>But it was in his lifelong battle against communism - first in Hollywood, then on the political stage - that Reagan's Christian beliefs had their most profound effect. Appalled by the religious repression and state-mandated atheism of Bolshevik Marxism, Reagan felt called by a sense of personal mission to confront the USSR. Inspired by influences as diverse as C.S. Lewis, Whittaker Chambers, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, he waged an openly spiritual campaign against communism, insisting that religious freedom was the bedrock of personal liberty. "The source of our strength in the quest for human freedom is not material, but spiritual," he said in his Evil Empire address. "And because it knows no limitation, it must terrify and ultimately triumph over those</p></p><p>&#x201c;He who introduces into public office the principles of primitive Christianity will change the face of the world.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Ronald Reagan, 1967, quoting Benjamin Franklin<br> <br> Long before George W. Bush&#x2019;s efforts to bring faith-based initiatives&#x2014;and the identification of evil in the world&#x2014;to the modern presidency, Ronald Reagan was using his own brand of Christianity to influence the course of world events in a conscious and consistent manner. In this bestselling, definitive spiritual biography of our fortieth president, God and Ronald Reagan, politician historian Paul Kengor presents a meticulously researched, fascinating account of Reagan&#x2019;s life as seen through the lens of his relationship to God, and traces this relationship to its culmination: America&#x2019;s battle against the atheistic Soviet Union. <br> <br> An intensely private man, Reagan kept his personal religious beliefs relatively quiet over the years. But as Kengor shows, Reagan&#x2019;s own words demonstrate that his religious orientation was shaped in his childhood&#x2014;and was retained with extraordinary consistency throughout his life. Schooled as a young man in the simple religious ideas of his Protestant mother, Reagan embraced Christianity with the fervor of a lonely boy who had found his first friend. Reagan&#x2019;s earthly father was a distant man who drank heavily and offered little in the way of comfort, so Reagan turned toward a heavenly father, a dependent and accessible God. Eventually, Kengor argues, Reagan&#x2019;s religious framework became a presidential one&#x2014;and one that ran head-on into an anti-religious war in Moscow. Nothing more strongly clashed with Reagan&#x2019;s belief system than Soviet communism; he saw the victims of Soviet oppression as weary soldiers in the great struggle for faith in the 20th century. To Reagan, the United States was a divinely ordained beacon of freedom&#x2014;a Shining City on a Hill&#x2014;and as Kengor conclusively demonstrates, it was this conviction that compelled him to a series of challenges that would eventually bring down Communism once and for all. <br> <br> Blending groundbreaking research and fascinating storytelling, God and Ronald Reagan, has forever changed our understanding of one of our most influential presidents.<p>Paul Kengor is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> extended-list bestseller <em>God and Ronald Reagan</em> as well as <em>God and George W.

A commercial failure, this book was the first stage of a massive, lifelong enterprise. Six editions and thirty-seven years later, <i>Leaves of Grass</i> had been recognized as one of the central masterworks of world poetry. This Library of America Paperback Classic includes two complete texts: the 1855 first edition and the magnificent culminating edition of 1891-1892.<br> For almost thirty years, The Library of America has presented America's best and most significant writing in acclaimed hardcover editions. Now, a new series, Library of America Paperback Classics, offers attractive and affordable books that bring The Library of America's authoritative texts within easy reach of every reader. Each book features an introductory essay by one of a leading writer, as well as a detailed chronology of the author's life and career, an essay on the choice and history of the text, and notes.<br> The contents of this Paperback Classic are drawn from <i>Walt Whitman: Poetry and Prose</i>, edited by Justin Kaplan, volume #3 in the Library of America series.</p><p>One of the great innovative figures in American letters, Walt Whitman created a daringly new kind of poetry that became a major force in world literature. <i>Leaves Of Grass</i> is his one book. First published in 1855 with only twelve poems, it was greeted by Ralph Waldo Emerson as "the wonderful gift . . . the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed." Over the course of Whitman's life, the book reappeared in many versions, expanded and transformed as the author's experiences and the nation's history changed and grew. Whitman's ambition was to creates something uniquely American. In that he succeeded. His poems have been woven into the very fabric of the American character. From his solemn masterpieces "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" and "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" to the joyous freedom of "Song of Myself," "I Sing the Body Electric," and "Song of the Open Road," Whitman's work lives on, an inspiration to the poets of later generations.The poetry of Walt Whitman is the cornerstone of modern American verse. He was America's first truly great poet and his influence is still evident today. The first edition of Whitman's "Leaves of Grass, published in 1855, was a revolutionary manifesto declaring America's independence from European cultural domination. His rhapsodic free verse broke radically with poetic, tradition: it was poetry about America, its democracy, its people, and its hopes. It was uniquely American without apology--brash, proud, optimistic, and filled with the bustling energy of the new and growing nation.<br>This collection brings together Whitman's greatest and most famous poems spanning the whole of his career. From the groundbreaking first edition of "Leaves of Grass are seven poems, including "Song of Myself" and "I Sing the Body Electric."<br>From later editions there are such masterpieces as "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking," and "I Hear America Singing." Also included is Whitman's great cycle of Civil War Poems, "Drum-Taps, which he wrote in the months when he was ministering to the wounded in battlefield hospitals. Concluding this collection is one of his last poems, "Good-bye My Fancy!"--his touching farewell to his muse, his life, and his readers.<br>More than one hundred years after his death, Walt Whitman's poetry has become part of the American heritage. It is a visionary which speaks as aptly to readers today as it will to future generations. As he says in "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "others...look back on me because I look'd forward to them." Whitman's poetry is a link that connects all Americans--past, present, and future.<br>This book features a deluxe cover, ribbon marker, top stain, and decorative endpaper with a nameplate.</p><h2>Thomas Nozkowski (Contemporary Painters Series)</h2><p>This book offers the first detailed account of the paintings of American artist Thomas Nozkowski (born 1944), creator of modestly-sized abstract works that swiftly convey what one writer described as &#39;a remarkable sense of freedom within constraint.&#39; As an emerging artist in the 1970s, Thomas Nozkowski&#39;s mature style developed in the wake of Minimalism, Pop Art and Colour Field painting and during a decade which became defined by movements - such as Conceptual and Performance art - that eschewed painting. While many artists identified with the notion of &#39;painting&#39;s terminal condition&#39;, Nozkowski chose to express personal experience through small-scale canvases that refused to adhere to &#39;a signature style&#39; or align themselves with a particular movement. Through John Yau&#39;s perceptive text, the trajectory of Nozkowski&#39;s very individual artistic pathway is clearly presented. Offering insightful context and discussion of specific works, this book provides the definitive narrative of an artist gifted with an original vision.</p><p><b>John Yau</b> is an award-winning poet, art critic and curator who has published many books of poetry, fiction, and art criticism."John Yau is the ideal writer for Nozkowski: Visually sensitive, lyrical, not given to hyperbole, he offers closely detailed, nicely sympathetic commentary. I especially admired the account of how early on Nozkowski learned to compose by repeating 'a pre-existing, eccentric shape until it established the edge' (23). Presenting excellent close accounts of several pictures, Yau rightly concludes that Nozkowski&#x2019;s great strength is his refusal to settle into a signature style. The discussion of what Nozkowski learnt from film is revelatory." &#x2014;David Carrie, <i>Artcritical</i><br><br><br>" ...a first rate book." &#x2014;David Carrier, <i>ArtCritical</i><br><br><br> Interview; review of Pace gallery exhibition &#x2014;<i>ArtCritical</i><br><br> &nbsp;<br><br>Interview &#x2014;<i>Brooklyn Rail </i>https://brooklynrail.org/2018/02/artseen/Thomas-Nozkowski-16-x-20</p><h2>Kumarasambhavam: The Origin Of The Young God</h2><p>Kumarasambhavam celebrates the love story of Siva and Parvati, whose passionate union results in the birth of their son, the young god Kumara. Beginning with a luminous description of the birth of Parvati, the poem proceeds in perfectly pitched sensuous detail through her courtship with Siva until the night of their wedding. It plays out their tale on the immense scale of supreme divinity, wherein the gods are viewed both as lovers and as cosmic principles. Composed in eight scintillating cantos, Kumarasambhavam continues to enchant readers centuries after it was first written. Hank Heifetz s sparkling translation brings to life the heady eroticism and sumptuous imagery of the original.</p><p>Kalidasa, perhaps the most extraordinary of India s classical poets, composed seven major works: three plays, two epic poems and two lyric poems. According to legend, he lived at the end of the fourth century, and was one the nine jewels in the court of the Gupta king Chandragupta II. Although very little is known about his life, Kalidasa s popularity has endured for centuries. Hank Heifetz is an awardwinning translator (from classical Indian languages and Spanish), poet and novelist. His many works include The Origin of the Young God, selected as one of the twenty-five best books of the year by the New York Village Voice in 1990, and The Four Hundred Poems of War and Wisdom, translated from classical Tamil (with George Hart), which was awarded the prize for best literary translation from a South Asian Language (2002) by the American Oriental Society. At present he is working on a novel and finishing a long literary translation of the ornate Sanskrit epic Sisupalavadha by the poet Magha.[Heifetz s] translation is magisterial, showing a vast knowledge of the poetics of the work itself and speaking with manifest authority ...

First published in 1855 as part of <i>Leaves of Grass, </i>it was revised and expanded by Whitman in subsequent editions in ways that sometimes undermined to its original freshness and vitality. Stephen Mitchell has gone back to the first edition and painstakingly compared it with the later versions, substituting only those revisions by Whitman that improved the poem. Here is Whitman at his most wild and raw, as large and lusty as life, fulfilling his promise to all future generations: <i>I stand on this spot with my soul. </i></p><p><b>Walt Whitman</b> (1819&#x2013;1892) was an American writer, poet, and humanist whose major work is <i>Leaves of Grass</i>."Grand but intimate, earthy but also dreamy."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Observer</i><br><br>"The great unrhymed, long-lined, self-celebratory sensation of the 1850s."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><h2>Forensic Science: An Introduction to Scientific and Investigative Techniques, Third Edition</h2><p><p></p> <p>Now revised and updated, this comprehensive work, long considered the top textbook in the forensics field, reaches far beyond the scope of those introductory texts that concentrate primarily on criminalistics.

Instead, in a daring stroke, Greil Marcus selects ten songs recorded between 1956 and 2008, then proceeds to dramatize how each embodies rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll as a thing in itself, in the story it tells, inhabits, and acts out&#x2014;a new language, something new under the sun.<br><br> &#x201c;Transmission&#x201d; by Joy Division. &#x201c;All I Could Do Was Cry&#x201d; by Etta James and then Beyonc�. &#x201c;To Know Him Is to Love Him,&#x201d; first by the Teddy Bears and almost half a century later by Amy Winehouse. In Marcus&#x2019;s hands these and other songs tell the story of the music, which is, at bottom, the story of the desire for freedom in all its unruly and liberating glory. Slipping the constraints of chronology, Marcus braids together past and present, holding up to the light the ways that these striking songs fall through time and circumstance, gaining momentum and meaning, astonishing us by upending our presumptions and prejudices. This book, by a founder of contemporary rock criticism&#x2014;and its most gifted and incisive practitioner&#x2014;is destined to become an enduring classic.</p><p>Another allusive, entertaining inquiry by veteran musicologist Marcus. . . .&nbsp;[He] does what he does best: make us feel smarter about what we&#x2019;re putting into our ears.&#x201d; <i>Kirkus</i>, starred review<br><i>Q: How did the idea for the book come about?</i><br> A: My editor Steve Wasserman wondered if I&#x2019;d write a history of rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll. I thought it was a terrible idea, that it had been done to death, well and poorly, that there was a finished and accepted narrative that rendered any retelling of the story redundant and pointless. But, then I thought: What if the book was nonchronological, discontinuous, and left out almost everyone who couldn&#x2019;t be left out (Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, James Brown, Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, Aretha Franklin, the Sex Pistols, Michael Jackson)? What if it neglected the well-known, iconic moments (the Beatles on the <i>Ed Sullivan Show,</i> Bob Dylan going electric), and centered instead on a small number of songs, each of which in its own unique way <i>embodied </i>rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll? That interested me and the idea became this book.<br><br><i>Q: Isn&#x2019;t this a ridiculous conceit?</i><br> A: Sure. The premise of the book trying to ascribe the entire history of a form containing hundreds of thousands of exemplars into ten is fundamentally absurd. That&#x2019;s what makes it fun.&nbsp;Maybe we could hold a contest to see what ten songs readers would choose to sum up this history.

In<i> Sensorium</i>, contemporary artists and writers explore the implications of the techno-human interface. Ten artists, chosen by an international team of curators, offer their own edgy investigations of embodied technology and the technologized body. These range from Matthieu Briand's experiment in "controlled schizophrenia" and Janet Cardiff and Georges Bures Miller's uneasy psychological soundscapes to Bruce Nauman's uncanny night visions and Fran�ois Roche's destabilized architecture. The art in <i>Sensorium</i>&#x2015;which accompanies an exhibition at the MIT List Visual Arts Center&#x2015;captures the aesthetic attitude of this hybrid moment, when modernist segmentation of the senses is giving way to dramatic multisensory mixes or transpositions. Artwork by each artist appears with an analytical essay by a curator, all of it prefaced by an anchoring essay on "The Mediated Sensorium" by Caroline Jones. In the second half of <i>Sensorium</i>, scholars, scientists, and writers contribute entries to an "Abecedarius of the New Sensorium." These short, playful pieces include Bruno Latour on "Air," Barbara Maria Stafford on "Hedonics," Michel Foucault (from a little-known 1966 radio lecture) on the "Utopian Body," Donna Haraway on "Compoundings," and Neal Stephenson on the "Viral." <i>Sensorium</i> is both forensic and diagnostic, viewing the culture of the technologized body from the inside, by means of contemporary artists' provocations, and from a distance, in essays that situate it historically and intellectually.

Leon Higginbotham, Vol 2)</h2><p>Few individuals have had as great an impact on the law--both its practice and its history--as A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr. A winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, he has distinguished himself over the decades both as a professor at Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard, and as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals. But Judge Higginbotham is perhaps best known as an authority on racism in America: not the least important achievement of his long career has been <em>In the Matter of Color</em>, the first volume in a monumental history of race and the American legal process. Published in 1978, this brilliant book has been hailed as the definitive account of racism, slavery, and the law in colonial America.<br> Now, after twenty years, comes the long-awaited sequel. In <em>Shades of Freedom</em>, Higginbotham provides a magisterial account of the interaction between the law and racial oppression in America from colonial times to the present, demonstrating how the one agent that should have guaranteed equal treatment before the law--the judicial system--instead played a dominant role in enforcing the inferior position of blacks. The issue of racial inferiority is central to this volume, as Higginbotham documents how early white perceptions of black inferiority slowly became codified into law. Perhaps the most powerful and insightful writing centers on a pair of famous Supreme Court cases, which Higginbotham uses to portray race relations at two vital moments in our history. The <em>Dred Scott</em> decision of 1857 declared that a slave who had escaped to free territory must be returned to his slave owner. Chief Justice Roger Taney, in his notorious opinion for the majority, stated that blacks were "so inferior that they had no right which the white man was bound to respect." For Higginbotham, Taney's decision reflects the extreme state that race relations had reached just before the Civil War. And after the War and Reconstruction, Higginbotham reveals, the Courts showed a pervasive reluctance (if not hostility) toward the goal of full and equal justice for African Americans, and this was particularly true of the Supreme Court. And in the <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> decision, which Higginbotham terms "one of the most catastrophic racial decisions ever rendered," the Court held that full equality--in schooling or housing, for instance--was unnecessary as long as there were "separate but equal" facilities. Higginbotham also documents the eloquent voices that opposed the openly racist workings of the judicial system, from Reconstruction Congressman John R. Lynch to Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan to W. E. B. Du Bois, and he shows that, ironically, it was the conservative Supreme Court of the 1930s that began the attack on school segregation, and overturned the convictions of African Americans in the famous Scottsboro case. But today racial bias still dominates the nation, Higginbotham concludes, as he shows how in six recent court cases the public perception of black inferiority continues to persist.<br> In <em>Shades of Freedom</em>, a noted scholar and celebrated jurist offers a work of magnificent scope, insight, and passion. Ranging from the earliest colonial times to the present, it is a superb work of history--and a mirror to the American soul.<br></p><p>In Shades of Freedom, Higginbotham provides a magisterial account of the interaction between law and racial oppression in America from colonial times to the present, demonstrating how the one agent that was entrusted to guarantee equal justice under the law - the judicial system - instead, more often played a dominant role in enforcing the inferior position of blacks, and, on some occasions, eradicated racial injustice. The precept of racial inferiority is central to this volume, as Higginbotham documents how early white perceptions of black inferiority slowly became codified into law. Perhaps the most powerful and insightful aspects center on a pair of famous Supreme Court cases, which Higgingbotham uses to portray race relations at two vital moments in our history. The Dred Scott decision of 1857 declared that under the United States Constitution, blacks were &#34;so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect&#34;. Higginbotham reveals the tragedy that, after the Civil War, and even during the Reconstruction period, the courts construed the new Constitutional amendments with such hostility that the dream of freedom was buried by judges with black robes, politicians posing as statesmen, and vigilantes in white hooded robes. In the Plessy v. Ferguson decision of 1896, which Higginbotham terms &#34;one of the most catastrophic racial decisions ever rendered&#34;, the Supreme Court legitimized racial segregation under the deceptive rationale of &#34;separate but equal&#34;, which, in practice, became always separate and never equal. Higginbotham also documents the eloquent voices that opposed the openly racist workings of the system, from Reconstruction Congressman John R. Lynch to Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan to African-American scholar W. E. B. Du Bois and Charles Hamilton Houston, William Hastie, and a few other lawyers - both black and white, Jew and Gentile - who confronted the legitimization of racism. To establish the nexus to decades of racism in the past, he asserts that, even today, racial bias still permeates the American consciousness. He shows how six recent events reveal that many public perceptions of black inferiority persist to this day.<br><strong>A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr.</strong> is Public Service Professor of Jurisprudence at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, and Of Counsel to Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton, &amp; Garrison.

Israel has been preparing for this day by creating a special and secretive IDF unit called Talpiot.</b> <p>Instead of being trained to fight, the few soldiers each year selected for Talpiot are taught how to <b>think.</b> In order to join this unit they have to commit to being in the army for ten years, rather than the three years a normal soldier serves. </p><p>Talpiots are taught advanced level physics, math and computer science as they train with soldiers from every other branch of the IDF. The result: young men and women become research and development machines. Talpiots have developed battle ready weapons that only Israel's top military officers and political leaders know about. They have also dramatically improved much of the weapons already in Israel's arsenal. </p><p></p><p>After leaving the army, Talpiots have become a major force in the Israeli economy, developing some of Israel's most famous and powerful companies. </p><p><i>Israel's Edge</i> contains dozens of interviews with Talpiot graduates and some of the early founders of the program. It explains Talpiot's <b>highly successful recruiting methods and discloses many of the secrets of the program's success. The book also profiles some of the most successful businesses founded by Talpiot graduates including CheckPoint, Compugen, Anobit, recently bought by Apple, and XIV, recently bought by IBM.</b> <b>No other military unit has had more of an impact on the State of Israel and no other unit will have more of an impact in the years ahead. The soldiers of Talpiot are truly unsung heroes.</b></p></p><p>As executive producer for the business network <i>CNBC</i>, Jason Gewirtz has covered Israel and Israeli business including working for the network from northern Israel during the Second Lebanon War in 2006, and following Warren Buffett to the country when the billionaire investor bought the metalworking company ISCAR, his first foreign purchase. Jason has also covered the attacks from Gaza on southern Israeli towns like Sderot and examined the economic impact. He produced <i>Beyond the Barrel: The Race to Fuel the Future</i>, which was shot on five continents and was largely focused on several Israeli-born energy technologies. He currently produces <i>Power Lunch</i>, which is broadcast live every day jointly from <i>CNBC</i>'s global headquarters and the New York Stock Exchange and can be viewed all over the world....you, the alumni of Talpiot, have stood at the forefront of the Israeli security-technology industry making... you are the flagship of the research and development systems of our security. <b>--Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</b> <p> Israel's Edge,...sheds light on the strategically vital and secretive Talpiot IDF program, which trains select groups of soldiers in how to conduct cutting edge defense research and development. </p><p> Asked why he (Jason Gewirtz) chose to write about this particular topic, the CNBC executive said, There is no other program like Talpiot in the world and it has had an enormous impact on Israel. It is also benefiting the world in a very positive way. </p><p> ...Each Talpiot graduate can make a one percent difference in a conflict or battle. They do it through technology, of course, but it is that technological advantage that gives Israel the edge it needs. </p><p> Israel must defend itself through a qualitative advantage and that is what Talpiot gives Israel the tools for this qualitative advantage that is so necessary for Israel, and the Jewish people's survival. --<b>Yaakov Lappin, <i>Jerusalem Post</i></b><br><br>Throughout the years, Talpiot has included and established a wide variety of unique and amazing tools that have been able to multiply the efficiency and strength of the intelligence services and military might of the IDF immeasurably. <b>--Former Prime Minister and former Defense Minister, Ehud Barak</b> </p><p> Israel's Edge is a well written look at how a new and vital department of the Israeli military came into being and its huge impact on the military as well as society. I learned a lot about a country that I have always been interested in and the detailed descriptions of wars, historic meetings, and momentous decisions rang true. </p><p> It is obvious from the first page that Jason Gewirtz researched this topic thoroughly. I read quite a lot of military books, both fiction and non-fiction, but I had never heard of Talpiot, which is now Israel's most elite unit. <b>--Ray Simmons, Readers Favorite 5-Star Review</b> </p><p> There is a new book out that is a must read for Israel fans and military buffs alike. Talpiot has been tasked with keeping Israel a generation ahead of a rapidly strengthening and technologically capable Iran, making this book extremely timely. There's something in here for history buffs, military watchers, people interested in technology and education and of course anyone interested in Israel and the Middle East. --<b>Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi, <i>The Times of Israel</i></b><br><br>Today, the program's contributions and importance are proven and felt more than ever.--<b>Former Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi</b> </p><p> The Talpiot unit accentuates one of the most eminent sources of strength of the State of Israel: its human capital. <b>--President Shimon Peres</b> </p><p> CyberArc, a great company.

It also presents an engaging political history of the last several decades, including such events as the Spanish Civil War, the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the march on the Pentagon to protest the Vietnam War. The book highlights Chomsky's views on the uses and misuses of the university as an institution, his assessment of useful political engagement, and his doubts about postmodernism. Because Chomsky is given ample space to articulate his views on many of the major issues relating to his work, both linguistic and political, this book reads like the autobiography that Chomsky says he will never write.<br> <br> Barsky's account reveals the remarkable consistency in Chomsky's interests and principles over the course of his life. The book contains well-placed excerpts from Chomsky's published writings and unpublished correspondence, including the author's own years-long correspondence with Chomsky.</p><p>Robert F. Barsky is Professor of English, Comparative Literature, French, and Jewish Studies at Vanderbilt University. He is the author of <i>Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent</i> (MIT Press, 1997).One can hardly complain that Chomsky doesn't write enough to give readers a sense of who he is and where he is coming from. As Barsky, a University of Western Ontario English professor who has corresponded with Chomsky since 1991, observes in his introduction, his subject "has published over seventy books and over a thousand articles . . . [in] linguistics, politics, cognitive sciences, and philosophy." But Chomsky hates biography and deplores personality cults; Barsky justifies his work by urging that "Chomsky's . . . political ideas cannot be fully understood without some knowledge of the organizations, movements, groups and individuals with whom he has had contact, either through study or discussion." His study thus focuses on two milieus: the world in which Chomsky was formed (his home and childhood, education, and professional breakthroughs) and the milieu he helped create (analyzing interactions of intellectuals, the university, and the state, and changes in intellectuals' roles in the twentieth century). An accessible overview; an appropriate acquisition where Chomsky's works circulate. <i>Mary Carroll</i></p><h2>The Politics Of Vision: Essays On Nineteenth-century Art And Society</h2><p>A leading critic and historian of nineteenth-century art and society explores in nine essays the interaction of art, society, ideas, and politics.</p><p>Linda NochlinIn nine essays accompanied by 62 plates, Nochlin ( Women, Art, and Power ) incisively questions the canonization of artists while examining the subordination of women as reflected in Western painting. She reminds us that the term "avant-garde" was once applied to Gustave Courbet's militantly radical realism. She laments Degas's "simpleminded anti-Semitism," yet finds that his prejudice, with a few flagrant exceptions, had little or no effect on his art. She traces a latent ideology of male domination and colonialism in the artificial orientalism of Eugene Delacroix and Jean-Leon Gerome. In the Belgian Leon Frederic's proletarian triptych Stages of a Worker's Life she perceives a reactionary clinging to fatalistic religious beliefs. Other pieces deal with Seurat, Manet, Pissarro, Puerto Rican realist painter Francisco Oller, and French reporter-illustrator Paul Renouard, whose drawing of long-suffering weavers influenced Van Gogh. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Word or Two Before You Go . . . .</h2><p>The renowned scholar and author of &#34;Teacher in America&#34; and &#34;The House of Intellect,&#34; examines how the urge to be snobbish, prestigious, technical, scientific, and abstract has led the English language astray</p><p></p><h2>Intermediate Algebra (softcover)</h2><p>Get Better Results with high quality content, exercise sets, and step-by-step pedagogy! The Miller/O&#39;Neill/Hyde author team continues to offer an enlightened approach grounded in the fundamentals of classroom experience in Intermediate Algebra. The text reflects the compassion and insight of its experienced author team with features developed to address the specific needs of developmental level students. Throughout the text, the authors communicate to students the very points their instructors are likely to make during lecture, and this helps to reinforce the concepts and provide instruction that leads students to mastery and success. Also included are Problem Recognition Exercises, designed to help students recognise which solution strategies are most appropriate for a given exercise. These types of exercises, along with the number of practice problems and group activities available, permit instructors to choose from a wealth of problems, allowing ample opportunity for students to practice what they learn in lecture to hone their skills. In this way, the book perfectly complements any learning platform, whether traditional lecture or distance-learning; its instruction is so reflective of what comes from lecture, that students will feel as comfortable outside of class as they do inside class with their instructor.</p><p>Molly ONeill is from Daytona State College, where she has taught for 22 years in the School of Mathematics.

And yet, the Golden City is so much more than postcard vistas. It's a town alive with history, culture, and a palpable sense of grandeur best captured by a man known as San Francisco's Brassai. Walking the city's foggy streets, the fourth-generation San Franciscan captures the local's view in dramatic black-and-white photos&#x2014; from fog-drenched mornings in North Beach and cable cars on Market Street to moody night shots of Coit Tower and the twists and turns of Lombard Street. In <em>San Francisco, Portrait of a City 1940&#x2013;1960</em>, Fred Lyon captures the iconic landscapes and one-of-a-kind personalities that transformed the city by the bay into a legend. Lyon's anecdotes and personal remembrances, including sly portraits of San Francisco characters such as writer Herb Caen, painters Richard Diebenkorn and Jean Varda, and madame and former mayor of Sausalito Sally Stanford add an artist's first-hand view to this portrait of a classic American city.</p><p>Fred Lyon has been photographing for 7 decades now, fourth generation San Franciscan, and found his calling in his youth as an apprentice at Gabriel Moulin's Studio before enrolling in Art Center in Los Angeles. Lyon has done photographic work for the Navy during WWII and for numerous fashion and home and garden magazines. Lyon's exhibitions include Palace Legion of Honor, Arts Institute in Chicago, and a <em>LIFE magazine</em> retrospective."At 90, Fred Lyon is a legendary San Franciscan photographer. He is now known for capturing the ethereal feel of the city and its people, but in the 1940s and '50s, Lyon was scrabbling to gain a footing in the magazine industry. Luckily, it was a good time to do so: San Francisco was entering a new golden age, consumed by a post-World War II hunger for creative expression. His new book, San Francisco, is a portrait of the city bursting with life, from its streets to its stores to its grandest palaces of art and culture." -Slate.com<br><br>"Stunning.. photographer Fred Lyon, now 90, magnificently captured the enticing noir decadence of San Francisco's Barbary Coast and the majesty of the rest of the city." -BoingBoing Holiday Gift Guide<br><br>"Lyon captures the seaside metropolis decades before the dot-coms invaded and rents skyrocketed, documenting everywhere from Chinatown's fish markets to Telegraph Hill's gorgeous homes to sailboats near Alcatraz to Union Square flower stands.

Before completing law school in New Orleans, he was an English teacher, a bar owner, a raft guide, a counselor at a Texas wilderness camp for juvenile delinquents, and an investigator for a criminal defense attorney in Washington, D.C.<b>1</b> <br> &nbsp; <br> It was after midnight, and Cain and his new partner, Grassley, watched as the excavator&#x2019;s blade went into the hole, emerging seconds later with another load of earth to add to the pile growing next to the grave. On the phone that afternoon, the caretaker of El Carmelo Cemetery had asked if they could do this at night. There were burials scheduled all day, and he didn&#x2019;t want to upset anyone. The time of day hadn&#x2019;t made any difference to Cain. Staying up all hours was his business. He just wanted this done. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three more scoops with the backhoe, the caretaker rotated the arm out of the way and his assistant jumped down into the hole with a long-handled spade. As he did that, the van from the medical examiner&#x2019;s office arrived. As it came up the access road, its headlights scanned across Cain and Grassley, and then paused over the exhumation. The caretaker&#x2019;s assistant climbed out of the hole, blinking against the bright light. Then he took the lifting straps from his boss and jumped back into the open grave. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cain watched the technicians coming up the hill. A man and a woman, young, no more than a few years out of college. Grassley&#x2019;s phone rang, and he checked the screen before he answered. He looked at Cain and took a few steps back. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; he said, and then he paused a while to listen. &#x201c;No, we&#x2019;re out at El Carmelo, in Pacific Grove &#x200b;&#x2014; &#x200b;you know, the Hanley thing?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Grassley was listening again, pressing his finger into his free ear to dull the excavator&#x2019;s diesel rumble. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He&#x2019;s right here. Hold on.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grassley handed him the phone. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the lieutenant,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;She wants to talk to you.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took the phone, stepping through the long shadows of the headstones toward the cypress trees at the top of the hill, where he would be farther from the excavator&#x2019;s idling engine. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This is Cain,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What can I do for you, Lieutenant?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Something came up. I need to reassign you.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We&#x2019;re right in the middle of something.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t pull you off if I had a choice,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t.

There was too much noise on the hilltop to hear her keystrokes. In less than twenty seconds she was back to him. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a golf course,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Right next to you.

She didn&#x2019;t even know about Lucy. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll talk when you get here, face to face. Not over the phone. Now give me Grassley. I need another word with him.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He started toward Grassley, then stopped when he saw the hole. He had to try one more time. He cupped his hand over the phone&#x2019;s mouthpiece, so she&#x2019;d hear him clearly. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I spent three weeks setting this up.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a wild goose chase, Cain.

Put Grassley on.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came back to Grassley and handed him the phone. It wasn&#x2019;t any use wondering why the lieutenant was pulling him away. Instead, he walked to the edge of the excavated grave and looked down, shining the flashlight he&#x2019;d been carrying. The caretaker&#x2019;s assistant was kneeling on top of the casket. He&#x2019;d dug trenches along its sides and was reaching down to fasten the lifting straps. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three decades underground, the kid wouldn&#x2019;t weigh much, at least. And from what Cain understood, by the time he&#x2019;d finally died, there hadn&#x2019;t been all that much to put in the casket anyway. The assistant climbed out of the hole again and handed the ends of the four straps to his boss. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cain checked up the hill and saw Grassley standing under the tree, one finger in his left ear to block the noise as he talked to their lieutenant. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Inspector Cain?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He turned around, putting his hand up to block the light shining in his face. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s me.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman from the ME&#x2019;s office lowered her light and came around to stand next to him. She leaned over to look down into the hole. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You&#x2019;re riding back with us in the van?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;We heard something like that.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not me,&#x201d; Cain said. &#x201c;I just got reassigned.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gestured up the hill toward Grassley. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll have to go. You or your partner can follow in his car.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Reassigned? It&#x2019;s two a.m. and we&#x2019;re &#x200b;&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She stopped, following Cain&#x2019;s eyes to look at the light coming toward them from the north. When the helicopter broke out of the clouds and into clear air, they could hear the whump of its rotors. Cain pointed up the hill toward his partner. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Inspector Grassley,&#x201d; Cain said. &#x201c;Make sure he gets in the van, that he rides with one of you. He might want to drive back on his own, but don&#x2019;t let him. We need the chain of custody. You understand. I don&#x2019;t want any problems later, some defense lawyer picking us apart.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I get it,&#x201d; the woman said. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to go,&#x201d; Cain said. He looked back into the hole, shining his light on the casket&#x2019;s black lid. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get this one right.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He paused on the way down the hill and looked back up at Grassley. They met each other&#x2019;s eyes and nodded, and that was all. Then he hurried across the access road, toward the long fairway that stretched between the graveyard and Del Monte Boulevard. <br> &nbsp; <br> When he reached the golf course and felt the short grass under his feet, he checked the sky to the north and saw that the helicopter was less than a minute away. He took out his cell phone and dialed Lucy&#x2019;s number. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Gavin?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sorry &#x200b;&#x2014; &#x200b;I didn&#x2019;t mean to &#x200b;&#x2014; &#x200b;I thought I&#x2019;d get your voicemail.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I was up.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked at his watch. It was a quarter past two. The grass on the fairway was slick with dew, and he could smell the ocean. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You&#x2019;re okay?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You&#x2019;re feeling sick again,&#x201d; he said. He could hear it in her voice. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not such a big deal,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Really.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d; she asked. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Down south, near Monterrey. For Hanley.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hanley?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The video we got, the guy who &#x200b;&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I remember. I can&#x2019;t stomach it right now.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No more,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I promise.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Are you coming soon?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Something came up,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re sending a helicopter, but I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s going on.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You have to hurry?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He glanced up at the helicopter, saw it swing around as it lined up for the fairway. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I ought to go.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Then call when you can,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Or better yet, just come.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;As soon as I can,&#x201d; he said. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Be careful,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Gavin, I mean it.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Try and get some sleep.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They hung up and he put the phone away. Then the helicopter came in just above the line of trees, and when it was hovering over the fairway, its spotlight lit up. He walked toward the white circle, one hand in the air to call the CHP pilot in.</p><h2>Raising Freethinkers: A Practical Guide for Parenting Beyond Belief</h2><p><p>Dale McGowan's popular and compassionate guide <em>Parenting Beyond Belief</em> was the first comprehensive book to offer a general philosophy of nonreligious parenting. <em>Raising Freethinkers</em> is a practical sequel, providing specific answers to common questions and more than 100 activities for parents and their children. <em>Raising Freethinkers</em> covers every topic nonreligious parents need to know to help their children with their own moral, intellectual, and emotional development, including sound advice on religious-extended-family issues, death and life, secular celebrations, wondering and questioning, and more.

Based on Saussure's lectures, <i>Course in General Linguistics</i> (1916) traces the rise and fall of the historical linguistics in which Saussure was trained, the synchronic or structural linguistics with which he replaced it, and the new look of diachronic linguistics that followed this change. Most important, Saussure presents the principles of a new linguistic science that includes the invention of semiology, or the theory of the "signifier," the "signified," and the "sign" that they combine to produce.<br><br>This is the first critical edition of <i>Course in General Linguistics</i> to appear in English and restores Wade Baskin's original translation of 1959, in which the terms "signifier" and "signified" are introduced into English in this precise way. Baskin renders Saussure clearly and accessibly, allowing readers to experience his shift of the theory of reference from mimesis to performance and his expansion of poetics to include all media, including the life sciences and environmentalism. An introduction situates Saussure within the history of ideas and describes the history of scholarship that made <i>Course in General Linguistics</i> legendary. New endnotes enlarge Saussure's contexts to include literary criticism, cultural studies, and philosophy.</p><p>Ferdinand de Saussure (1857&#x2013;1913) received his doctorate from the University of Leipzig in 1880 and lectured on ancient and modern languages in Paris until 1891. He then taught Sanskrit and Indo-European languages at the University of Geneva until the end of his life. Among his published works is <i>Memoir on the Primitive System of Vowels in Indo-European Languages</i>, published in 1878 when Saussure was twenty-one.Wade Baskin (1924&#x2013;1974) was a professor of languages at Southeastern Oklahoma State University and translated many works from French, including books by Jean-Paul Sartre.Perry Meisel is professor of English at New York University. His books include <i>The Myth of the Modern</i>, <i>The Literary Freud</i>, and <i>The Myth of Popular Culture</i>.Haun Saussy is university professor in the Department of Comparative Literature at the University of Chicago. His books include <i>The Problem of a Chinese Aesthetic</i> and <i>Great Walls of Discourse</i>.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Narrow Edge: A Tiny Bird, an Ancient Crab, and an Epic Journey</h2><p><b>In a volume as urgent and eloquent as Rachel Carson&#x2019;s <i>Silent Spring</i>, this book&#x2014;winner of the Southern Environmental Law Center's 2016 <i>Reed Environmental Writing Award</i> in the book category&#x2014;reveals how the health and well-being of a tiny bird and an ancient crab mirrors our own</b><br> Winner of the 2016 <b>Rachel Carson Environment Book Award</b> given by the Society of Environmental Journalists<br> &nbsp;Each year, red knots, sandpipers weighing no more than a coffee cup, fly a near-miraculous 19,000 miles from the tip of South America to their nesting grounds in the Arctic and back. Along the way, they double their weight by gorging on millions of tiny horseshoe crab eggs. Horseshoe crabs, ancient animals that come ashore but once a year, are vital to humans, too: their blue blood safeguards our health. Now, the rufa red knot, newly listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, will likely face extinction in the foreseeable future across its entire range, 40 states and 27 countries. The first United States bird listed because global warming imperils its existence, it will not be the last: the red knot is the twenty-first century&#x2019;s &#x201c;canary in the coal mine.&#x201d; Logging thousands of miles following the knots, shivering with the birds out on the snowy tundra, tracking them down in bug-infested marshes, Cramer vividly portrays what&#x2019;s at stake for millions of shorebirds and hundreds of millions of people living at the sea edge. <i>The Narrow Edge</i> offers an uplifting portrait of the tenacity of tiny birds and of the many people who, on the sea edge we all share, keep knots flying and offer them safe harbor.&nbsp;Winner of the 2016 <b>National Academies Communications Award</b> for best book that honors the best in science communications.

It is the backbone of the new generation of medium-scale models under development at major central banks and international policy institutions, and provides the theoretical underpinnings of the inflation stability-oriented strategies adopted by most central banks throughout the industrialized world. This graduate-level textbook provides an introduction to the New Keynesian framework and its applications to monetary policy. Using a canonical version of the New Keynesian model as a reference framework, Jordi Gal explores issues pertaining to the design of monetary policy, including the determination of the optimal monetary policy and the desirability of simple policy rules. He analyzes several extensions of the baseline model, allowing for cost-push shocks, nominal wage rigidities, and open economy factors. In each</p><p><p>"Jordi Gal� provides an authoritative overview of the research that revolutionized monetary economics during the past decade, by embedding sticky prices in a coherent dynamic general equilibrium framework--thus providing a novel and much clearer positive and normative analysis of monetary policy.

The impetus arose from Parliament's Licensing Order, which censored all printed materials and ultimately led to arrests, book burnings, and other authoritarian abuses. Milton's polemic, strengthened by biblical and classical allusions, remains enduringly significant and ranks among the world's most eloquent defenses of the right to free speech.<br>In addition to the "Areopagitica," this collection of Milton's most significant prose works includes "Of Education," a tract on educational reform; "Meditation Upon Divine Justice and The Death of King Charles the First," a rationale for the overthrow of the monarchy; "The Doctrine and Disciple of Divorce," in which the author urges the enactment of a virtually unheard-of reform allowing divorce for incompatibility and the right of remarriage; and "Autobiographical Extracts," featuring highlights from Milton's memoirs.</p><p>One of the greatest of English poets, John Milton (1608&#x2013;74) is best known for his immortal epic, <i>Paradise Lost.</i> A prolific pamphleteer and polemicist, he is also a giant in the history of political thought and philosophy who opposed state-sponsored religion and championed liberty of conscience.</p><h2>Handbook of Russian Literature</h2><p>This first encyclopedia of its kind in English covers ten centuries of Russian literature and includes nearly 1,000 entries by leading scholars.&nbsp; It will be an indispensable guide for students or the general reader.<br>&#x201c;The <i>Handbook</i> is an Eden for browsers... a dependable, illuminating guide.&#x201d;&#x2015;Robert Taylor, <i>Boston Globe</i><br>&#x201c;A comprehensive survey in one volume of one of the world&#x2019;s richest national literatures.&nbsp; The volume includes entries on authors, genres, literary movements, and period studies, together with reviews of notable journals.&nbsp; The lengthiest entries run to more than 6,000 words, the shortest have been kept to a single paragraph, giving the book value both for ready reference and as a collection of history and criticism.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>Booklist</i><br>&#x201c;The achievement here is grand, the knowledge collected invaluable.&#x201d;&#x2015;Theoharis C.

Based on careful reading of Africans' oral histories and traditions, written documents, and visual evidence, the book focuses not on the mechanics or operation of the Atlantic slaving system, but rather on the beliefs, ideas, and worldviews of the Africans who experienced it. It examines the internal workings of African societies and their members at various strata in the transatlantic era, strongly emphasizing the global context and the multiplicity of African experiences during that period, and interpreting the process of transatlantic slaving and its consequences through largely African and diasporic primary sources. By integrating Africans' viewpoints with critical interpretations, <em>Transatlantic Africa: 1440-1888</em> balances intellectual rigor with broad accessibility, helping students to think about the Atlantic slave trade from a new perspective.</p><p><br><strong>Kwasi Konadu</strong> is Associate Professor of History at The City University of New York.

Alden Weir, and their followers. These artists and writers came together to work in the modest Cos Cob section of Greenwich, Connecticut, testing new styles and new themes in the stimulating company of colleagues. This beautiful book is the first to examine the art colony at Cos Cob and the role it played in the development of American Impressionist art. <p>During the art-colony period, says Susan Larkin, Greenwich was changing from a farming and fishing community to a prosperous suburb of New York. The artists who gathered in Cos Cob produced work that reflects the resulting tensions between tradition and modernity, nature and technology, and country and city. The artists' preferred subjects&#x2014;colonial architecture, quiet landscapes, contemplative women&#x2014;held a complex significance for them, which Larkin explores. Drawing on maritime history, garden design, women's studies, and more, she places the art colony in its cultural and historical context and reveals unexpected depth in paintings of enormous popular appeal.</p></p><p>This generously illustrated book accompanies an exhibition that opens at the National Academy of Design in New York on 14 February 2001 and then travels to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, on 17 June and the Denver Art Museum on 27 October.

This most memorable of McMurtry&#39;s novels, set in a sleepy Texas town, tells of teenagers taking the final steps from childhood to adulthood.</p><p>In <i>The Last Picture Show</i> Larry McMurtry introduced characters who would show up again in later novels, <i>Texasville</i> and <i>Duane's Depressed</i>. This first volume of the trilogy drops the reader into the one-stoplight town of Thalia, Texas, where Duane Moore, his buddy Sonny, and his girlfriend Jacy are all stumbling along the rocky road to adulthood. Duane wants nothing more than to marry Jacy; Sonny wants what Duane has; and Jacy wants to get the hell out of Thalia any way she can. This is not a novel of big ideas or defining moments; over the course of a year Duane and Jacy make up and break up, Sonny begins an affair with his high-school football coach's wife, and the only movie house in town closes its doors forever. Yet it is out of these small-town experiences--a nude swimming party in Wichita, a failed sexual encounter during a senior trip, a botched elopement, an enlistment--that McMurtry builds his tale and reveals his characters' hearts. No epiphanies here, just a lot of hard-won experience that leaves none of his protagonists particularly wiser, though they're all a little sadder by the end. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Expedition of Humphry Clinker (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>William Thackeray called it "the most laughable story that has ever been written since the goodly art of novel-writing began."

Dave retired after 30 years of teaching writing in college, high school, junior high and grade school. <p> When their son was in the fourth grade, Dave and his wife Lea realized that he was not being given the training they felt he needed and elected to homeschool him in language arts. To prepare him for college writing, they designed a series of lessons, which he completed by the age of twelve. That summer, they enrolled him in freshman English at Lake Michigan College, where he received his first A in college work. He is now a poet and university professor. </p><p> Dave and Lea later turned these lessons into the <i>Writing Strands</i> series of books. While Dave never maintained that the series could create poets for other homeschooling parents, he felt that if children worked successfully through the <i>Writing Strands</i> series of books, they would have the skills needed for the challenge of any writing assignment in their undergraduate college work.</p></p><h2>Kim (Modern Library 100 Best Novels)</h2><p><b>Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time</b><br><br>Filled with lyrical, exotic prose and nostalgia for Rudyard Kipling&#x2019;s native India, <i>Kim</i> is widely acknowledged as the author&#x2019;s greatest novel and a key element in his winning the 1907 Nobel Prize in Literature. It is the tale of an orphaned sahib and the burdensome fate that awaits him when he is unwittingly dragged into the Great Game of Imperialism. During his many adventures, he befriends a sage old Tibetan lama who transforms his life. As Pankaj Mishra asserts in his Introduction, &#x201c;To read the novel now is to notice the melancholy wisdom that accompanies the native boy&#x2019;s journey through a broad and open road to the narrow duties of the white man&#x2019;s world: how the deeper Buddhist idea of the illusion of the self, of time and space, makes bearable for him the anguish of abandoning his childhood.&#x201d;</p><p>One of the particular pleasures of reading <i>Kim</i> is the full range of emotion, knowledge, and experience that Rudyard Kipling gives his complex hero. Kim O'Hara, the orphaned son of an Irish soldier stationed in India, is neither innocent nor victimized. Raised by an opium-addicted half-caste woman since his equally dissolute father's death, the boy has grown up in the streets of Lahore: <blockquote> Though he was burned black as any native; though he spoke the vernacular by preference, and his mother-tongue in a clipped uncertain sing-song; though he consorted on terms of perfect equality with the small boys of the bazar; Kim was white--a poor white of the very poorest. </blockquote> From his father and the woman who raised him, Kim has come to believe that a great destiny awaits him. The details, however, are a bit fuzzy, consisting as they do of the woman's addled prophecies of "'a great Red Bull on a green field, and the Colonel riding on his tall horse, yes, and'--dropping into English--'nine hundred devils.'" <p> In the meantime, Kim amuses himself with intrigues, executing "commissions by night on the crowded housetops for sleek and shiny young men of fashion." His peculiar heritage as a white child gone native, combined with his "love of the game for its own sake," makes him uniquely suited for a bigger game. And when, at last, the long-awaited colonel comes along, Kim is recruited as a spy in Britain's struggle to maintain its colonial grip on India. Kipling was, first and foremost, a man of his time; born and raised in India in the 19th century, he was a fervid supporter of the Raj. Nevertheless, his portrait of India and its people is remarkably sympathetic. Yes, there is the stereotypical Westernized Indian Babu Huree Chander with his atrocious English, but there is also Kim's friend and mentor, the Afghani horse trader Mahub Ali, and the gentle Tibetan lama with whom Kim travels along the Grand Trunk Road. The humanity of his characters consistently belies Kipling's private prejudices, and raises <i>Kim</i> above the mere ripping good yarn to the level of a timeless classic. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Kim is an orphan, living from hand to mouth in the teeming streets of Lahore. One day he meets a man quite unlike anything in his wide experience, a Tibetan lama on a quest. Kim's life suddenly acquires meaning and purpose as he becomes the lama's guide and protector--his chela. Other forces are at work as Kim is sucked into the intrigue of the Great Game and travels the Grand Trunk Road with his lama.<p></p><p>How Kim and the lama meet their respective destinies on the road and in the mountains of India forms one of the most compelling adventure tales of all time.</p></p><h2>Oceanography: An Invitation to Marine Science</h2><p>Cengage Learning in partnership with National Geographic Society brings course concepts to life with interactive learning, study, and exam preparation tools along with market leading text content for introductory oceanography courses.

The book's text is supported by many illustrations, photos, and works of art. <b></b> For professional and amateur artists. </p></p><p><p> Highly acclaimed as one of the most comprehensive and dynamic explorations of figure drawing available, this innovative and in-depth text brings together the structural, anatomical, organizational, and expressive factors that make for more compelling creative representations of the human form. </p> <p> Author <b>Nathan Goldstein</b> examines the universal conditions and forces at work in the best examples of figure drawing by old and contemporary masters alike, and incorporates almost 500 examples, including a full set of his own, clear, anatomical illustrations. </p> <b>SIXTH EDITION HIGHLIGHTS</b> <ul> <li>NEW&#x2014;Features an expanded Chapter Eight, which now contains 49 photographs of the human figure.</li> <li>NEW&#x2014;Features additional works of art new to this edition.</li> <li>NEW&#x2014;A glossary of terms to increase the ease of reading for the user.</li> </ul> <p> For anyone interested in refreshing or broadening their understanding of drawing, this how-to-see-it book enhances the ability to experience and state the world in visual terms that communicate, and to better comprehend the options and obstacles often confronted when drawing. </p> <p> <b>Nathan Goldstein</b> emphasizes drawing as a responsive encounter with the physical world and examines the following factors: a subject's measurable, structural actualities, its relational possibilities, and its emotive character. He explores the tools and materials of drawing, and the concepts, forces, and "pathologies," or common failings of perception, organization, and expression in drawing. In addition, Goldstein presents suggested exercises to help the reader experience the concepts and processes dealt with in each chapter. </p><p> That the five earlier incarnations of <i>Figure Drawing</i> met with immediate and substantial acceptance among artists and students alike is a matter of personal gratification and a dependable sign that something about the book's overall presentation and character has struck a responsive chord among those who want to reinforce their interest in figure drawing with more information and options. This new edition tries to serve those interests with even greater clarity and effect. </p> <p> The earlier editions&#x2014;expanded in some places, simplified in others, and further strengthening the original text&#x2014;were shaped by the opportunities I have had in the intervening years of examining the book's effect on countless readers by the good counsel of colleagues arid students, and by the insights and experiences that time provides. The thing about time, though, is that it keeps on providing new notions. Although with each edition I was satisfied with the book's essential form and content, it occurred to me after a few years that yet another revision was in order. So it is again. </p> <p> I am, however, a staunch believer in the old adage, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." Consequently, this sixth edition continues in the same vein as its predecessors, with a few useful additions and changes. Again, I have included a number of colorplates to show how "the queen of the visual elements" can amplify our creative purposes. Most of the works new to this edition are by contemporary artists, and each strongly amplifies various matters of importance in the text. Additionally, I have expanded Chapter 8 with photographs showing the figure's forms in ways I hope the reader will find useful as a source of study and practice. As for the text, the change I am proudest of is that rarest of all occurrences: a reversal of the usual tendency for new editions to gain weight. This edition's slightly reduced text is, I believe, clearer and stronger than previous texts, and it contains some useful adjustments in presenting the relative importance of the book's several themes. </p> <p> If some of these additions and changes originated with me, many came from readers, students, and colleagues too numerous to list here, and I want to thank them in this public way for helping me to more closely realize my goals on this sixth time around. Always the optimist, I have high hopes for this latest revision. But, always the artist and teacher, I know in my bones that it is the quality and quantity of good figure drawings reproduced in the text that will give this book its ultimate worth. For that important reason, I have tried to reproduce figure drawings that represent a wide range of styles, themes, and eras, though I am less concerned with when they were done than with what they say and how well they say it. </p> <p> As before, this edition is designed to assist the art student, the amateur, the art teacher, and the practicing artist in developing a more extensive understanding of the figurative and abstract considerations of drawing observed or envisioned human forms. </p> <p> I continue to hold the single assumption that the artist-reader's interest in expanding his or her understanding is motivated by a wish to comprehend those universal qualities present in the best examples of figure drawing by old and contemporary masters alike, rather than by a wish for ready-made formulas and techniques. Although five of the eight chapters provide suggested exercises, these exercises are intended to clarify and reinforce the particulars and potentialities of the chapter's subject, not to suggest canons of figure drawing. The exercises may be simplified, embellished, otherwise varied, or even be bypassed without interrupting the flow of the text. </p> <p> The term <i>figure drawing</i> as used here refers to drawings of the draped as well as nude figure, and drawings of parts of the figure or drawings in which the figure represents only a small part of the configuration. Very often, the beginner is too much in awe of the figure to bring to bear those skills he or she does possess, and which are more readily applied to still life and landscape subjects. This broader view, in regarding the figure in its context among the multitude of things that make up our physical world, helps us to recognize that many of the concepts and skills we call on in responding to the things around us apply just as much to the figure's spirit and form. </p> <p> For the same reason, I have abandoned the traditional approach to anatomy, which is isolated from the figure's dynamic and humanistic qualities and often seems clinical and remote from living individuals. Instead, I have tried to integrate with master drawings and sculptures creative applications of the various parts of anatomy under discussion and to show anatomy's role as both servant and source of structural and dynamic inventions. </p> <p> In this volume, anatomy is regarded as only one of the four basic factors of figure drawing. The best figure drawings always reveal a congenial interaction among the factors of <i>structure, anatomy, design,</i> and <i>expression.</i> The best teachers, sensitive to this interplay, try to show students the mutually reinforcing behavior of these factors, both in their teaching and in their own creative work. </p> <p> To my knowledge, no one has previously written a comprehensive discussion of the ways in which the four factors assist and govern each other. If this formulation of the concepts at work (and at play) in the figure helps the reader to better focus on the options and obstacles of figure drawing, or even if in contesting aspects of this presentation the reader is aided in forming a pattern of issues more suited to his or her views, I will have achieved my goal. </p> <p> I would like to acknowledge my debt to tire writings of Rudolf Arnheim, whose important contributions to the psychology of perception frequently clarified and occasionally confirmed my views on various aspects of perception as they apply to figure drawing. </p> <p> I wish to express my gratitude and thanks to the many students, artists, and friends whose needs, advice, and interests helped to shape and test the views presented in earlier editions of this book and in this present revised form of the book. I wish also to thank the many museums and individuals who granted permission to reproduce works from their collections. I must thank Charles D. Wise of Medical Plastics Laboratory, Gatesville, Texas, for his cooperation in providing the skeleton replica reproduced in Chapter 3; David Yawnick, Don Hirsh, and Gabrielle Keller for their excellent photographic skills; the late Walter R. Welch for his help with the book's first edition; and Bud Therien of Prentice Hall, whose co-operation and generosity in numerous ways have made this a better book. </p> <p> The author also thanks the following reviewers for their helpful suggestions: Professor Stephen Lewinter, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga; Professor Anita Giddings, Herron School of Art, Indianapolis, Indiana; Professor Janice Kmetz, University of Minnesota at Duluth; and Professor Elen Feinberg, University of New Mexico at Albuquerque. </p> <p> My deepest gratitude to Harriet and Jessica for their practical assistance, care, and understanding, and to my daughter Sarah Hannah, herself a published writer, whose interest, affection, and patience are always there. </p> <p> <b>Nathan Goldstein</b> </p></p><h2>The Curse of Beauty: The Scandalous &amp; Tragic Life of Audrey Munson, America's First Supermodel</h2><p><b>The tumultuous and heartbreaking life of a world-famous model</b><b> whose riveting story of beauty, fame, passion, murder, and madness in the Gilded Age captivated a nation.</b><br><br>As America was stepping into the modern era, one great beauty became the artist&#x2019;s model of choice. Her perfect form became the emblem of the Gilded Age and appears on the greatest monuments of New York and the nation. Supermodel, actress, icon&#x2014;her beauty paved the way for a life of glamour, passion, and ultimately tragedy. She dated the millionaires of the fashionable Newport colony, became the first American movie star ever to appear naked in a film, but her promising film career collapsed, her doctor fell in love with her and killed his own wife, and on her fortieth birthday, her mother committed her to an insane asylum. She remained there until her death in 1996 at the age of 104 and is now buried in an unmarked grave. Her name is Audrey Munson.<br> <br> Many readers will recognize Audrey Munson, and have walked by her in the street, without even knowing her name. She stands atop New York&#x2019;s Municipal Building. She sits as &#x201c;Miss Manhattan&#x201d; and &#x201c;Miss Brooklyn&#x201d; outside the Brooklyn Museum, is immortalized on the Manhattan Bridge, the Frick Mansion, the New York Public Library, and the Pulitzer Fountain outside the Plaza Hotel.

For almost a quarter of the century, he covered every major event in New York: Whether it was a celebrity scandal or a mafia trial, a Wall Street fraud or a record art sale, a high society wedding or a terrorist attack, he was there. He comes from a family of generations of artists on both sides, some of whom were active at the same time as the sculptors and painters in this book. He has reported from dozens of countries and some non-countries, from Afghanistan to Antarctica. His most recent posting was as <i>The Times</i> correspondent in Rome, Italy."Audrey Munson was famous for posing naked and being cloaked in scandal. The Gilded Age model and silent-film star dated America&#x2019;s richest bachelor, was the toast of the 1915 World&#x2019;s Fair, and inspired scores of painters and sculptors in the beaux-arts style. This proto-celebrity vanished long ago but her neoclassical features and figure live on in allegorical monuments and paintings across the United States.

(Darn it!) When things don&#x2019;t go our way, we need specific skills and strategies to regain our balance and to keep ourselves from spiraling downward.

This volume provides a comprehensible guide to his work by a wide range of experts who are actively engaged in new work on Wittgenstein. The essays, which are both expository and original, address central themes in his philosophy of mind, language, logic, and mathematics and clarify the connections among the different stages in the development of his work.</p><p>Visiting his student Ludwig Wittgenstein one night only to find him in the throes of despair, Bertrand Russell facetiously asked whether it was logic or his sins that was troubling him. "Both," Wittgenstein gravely replied. Is it any wonder that Wittgenstein the man, as well as his elusive but profound philosophical work, continue to fascinate? "Any attempt at a definitive exposition of his ideas would be doomed to failure," according to editor Hans Sluga; therefore, the <i>Cambridge Companion to Wittgenstein</i> is intended mainly "to alert readers to some of the most important and most interesting issues raised in Wittgenstein's philosophical writings." For the most part, the 14 essays succeed. <p> With the exception of Thomas Ricketts's discussion of the <i>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</i>, the focus of the essays is on Wittgenstein's later work, particularly the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>. His conception of philosophy is approached from various angles by Robert J. Fogelin, Newton Garver, and Stanley Cavell. The format of Cavell's essay--which consists of his lecture notes from the 1960s and 1970s interspersed with afterthoughts from the 1990s--is somewhat irritating, but the depth of his insight makes up for it. Other essays deal with Wittgenstein's ideas about the philosophy of mathematics, ethics, necessity and normativity, the self, and epistemology. Especially worthy of attention is Donna M. Summerfield's "Fitting and Tracking: Wittgenstein on Representation." In explaining the development of Wittgenstein's thought about representation, Summerfield also manages to sketch the philosophical problem of representation in careful and perspicacious detail. All in all, <i>The Cambridge Companion to Wittgenstein</i> is recommended to anyone grappling with its enigmatic subject. <i>--Glenn Branch</i></p>Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) is one of the most important and influential philosophers of the twentieth century, and also one of the least accessible.

The volume takes account of recent developments that have enriched our picture of the Republic. These include the continuing archaeological exploration of Italy, increasingly sophisticated approaches to textual sources, and the opening up of new areas of historical study and debate such as the nature of the republican political system, Roman identity formation, representation of the body, collective memory, and demography and social structure. At the same time, the book retains the drama of the Republicrsquo;s rise and fall. The Companion is divided into three parts. The opening section emphasizes both the evidence of texts and physical remains, and the models and assumptions that scholars bring to these artifacts. This section includes coverage of the role played by the physical geography and environment of Italy. The second part offers a compact but detailed narrative of military and political developments from the birth of Rome through to the death of Julius Caesar; while the third and longest part highlights recent research and current controversies in the field.<b>Nathan Rosenstein</b> is Professor of History at the Ohio State University.

Hasselborg (Lanternlight Library)</h2><p><i>Bear Man of Admiralty Island</i> is the life story of a rugged loner and self-taught naturalist who came to southeastern Alaska in 1901 to seek his fortune in the awe-inspiring wilderness but found his destiny instead. In the process, this sturdy Midwesterner learned the skills of a prospector, fisherman, trapper, guide, boatbuilder, and homesteader. At all these things he eventually excelled, but his greatest fame came from his greatest skill: he was a peerless bear hunter. He joined several natural history expeditions and worked for about ten years as a specimen collector and guide. He later guided sportsmen and photographers interested in Southeastern's wildlife and majestic natural beauty. As his respect for the great brown bears increased, he lost his interest in killing them, and his experiences inspired conservationists who lobbied to protect Admiralty Island from logging. Hasselborg's keen wit, fierce independence, and eccentric ways attracted much attention during his lifetime. He was an extraordinary man who was in some ways a perfectly ordinary Alaskan of his time, and author Howe reflects on both sides of that character in a balanced, detailed way.</p><p><b>John R. Howe</b> currently resides in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he directs an Internet/World Wide Website for writers and publishers. Between 1980 and 1992, while writing this book, he lived in Juneau, Alaska, working as a videographer, freelance writer, teacher, and conservationist. His articles on wildlife subjects have been published in <i>Audubon Defenders</i>, and <i>Alaska</i> magazines. He is a graduate of Stanford University and holds a masters degree in sociobiology and communications from San Francisco State University.Bear Man Of Admiralty Island is the life story of a remarkable Alaska pioneer who became well known as a guide, naturalist, homesteader, and frontier character. Lured north by the Klondike gold rush at the turn of the century, Allen Hasselborg hunted bears for the Alaska fur trade, then became a guide, and collected natural history specimens for scientists from the University of California and the Smithsonian Institutions. He later guided nature photographers and writers, and attracted national attention when he was caught in the middle of a key political battle between the Alaska timber industry and East Coast conservationists. Bear Man Of Admiralty Island is a superbly researched and ably written biography of an interesting man living in interesting times. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>The Norton Field Guide to Writing with 2016 MLA Update: with Readings</h2><p><p><strong>THIS TITLE HAS BEEN UPDATED TO REFLECT THE 2016 MLA UPDATE.</strong></p><p><strong>Flexible, easy to use, just enough detail&#x2015;and the number-one best selling rhetoric.</strong></p><em>The Norton Field Guide to Writing</em>&#x2019;s flexibility and ease of use have made it the leading rhetoric text on the market&#x2015;and a perfect choice for committees representing varying teaching styles.

Were there factors beyond their control? Or were they simply beaten to it by the Americans? Operation Epsilon: The Farm Hall Transcripts throws some light on these questions, which have exercised the minds of scientists and historians for 50 years. It contains information which has been classified top secret since 1945 and only recently declassified after years of pressure from scientists and historians. In Germany at the end of the war, Anglo-American Intelligence rounded up the most well-known nuclear scientists and transferred them to Farm Hall, a country house in Cambridgeshire. They were to be &#34;guests&#34; there for six months. Unknown to the scientists, Farm Hall was bugged and their conversation recorded, transcribed and translated. This book publishes these translated transcripts for the first time. The scientists were still captive when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Their reactions to the news ranged from disbelief to the contemplation of suicide. The ensuing discussions are transcribed in this book, giving a valuable insight into the state of knowledge of the Germans during the war. The transcripts also reveal much about the states of mind of these men. Family worries, personal ambition, political beliefs, thoughts of escape and their escalating frustration at their continued captivity are all graphically depicted in their conversations. For instance, one was awarded a Nobel prize while in captivity, but he was not permitted to receive it in person at the time. The background to the transcripts in described in the introduction by Professor Sir Charles Frank FRS, Sir Charles worked in German laboratories before the war, and then for British Intelligence during the war on the Farm Hall project. Sir Charles has also re-translated a section containing important technical detail as the original translation was inaccurate. The original German transcription for this section is also reproduced for the historical record.</p><p>"It is fascinating to observe the varied and ever-changing moods and attitudes of the scientists: truculence and good-humoured resignation, complaints and compliments, despair and hope alternate and merge. Moral scruples about working on the atomic bomb are not evident. Equally interesting is the attitude of the 'hosts': the two officers did their best for their guests but without much help from above...This book will remain for many years a happy hunting ground for historians, political scientists and psychologists." -- <i>Nature</i></p><h2>Herder: Philosophical Writings (Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy)</h2><p>Herder is a figure of considerable importance in the history of philosophy and the history of ideas.

German Studies Review, Joe K. Fugate</p><h2>Lonesome Dove: A Novel (Lonesome Dove, 3)</h2><p>Bestselling winner of the 1986 Pulitzer Prize, <i>Lonesome Dove</i> is an American classic. First published in 1985, Larry McMurtry's epic novel combined flawless writing with a storyline and setting that gripped the popular imagination, and ultimately resulted in a series of four novels and an Emmy-winning television miniseries. Now, with an introduction by the author, <i>Lonesome Dove</i> is reprinted in an S&amp;S Classic Edition. <br> <i>Lonesome Dove,</i> by Larry McMurtry, the author of <i>Terms of Endearment,</i> is his long-awaited masterpiece, the major novel at last of the American West as it really was. <br> A love story, an adventure, an American epic, <i>Lonesome Dove</i> embraces <i>all</i> the West -- legend and fact, heroes and outlaws, whores and ladies, Indians and settiers -- in a novel that recreates the central American experience, the most enduring of our national myths. <br> Set in the late nineteenth century, <i>Lonesome Dove</i> is the story of a cattle drive from Texas to Montana -- and much more. It is a drive that represents for everybody involved not only a daring, even a foolhardy, adventure, but a part of the American Dream -- the attempt to carve out of the last remaining wilderness a new life. <br> Augustus McCrae and W. F. Call are former Texas Rangers, partners and friends who have shared hardship and danger together without ever quite understanding (or wanting to understand) each other's deepest emotions. Gus is the romantic, a reluctant rancher who has a way with women and the sense to leave well enough alone. Call is a driven, demanding man, a natural authority figure with no patience for weaknesses, and not many of his own. He is obsessed with the dream of creating his own empire, and with the need to conceal a secret sorrow of his own. The two men could hardly be more different, but both are tough, redoubtable fighters who have learned to count on each other, if nothing else. <br> Call's dream not only drags Gus along in its wake, but draws in a vast cast of characters: <br> -- Lorena, the whore with the proverbial heart of gold, whom Gus (and almost everyone else) loves, and who survives one of the most terrifying experiences any woman could have...<br> -- Elmira, the restless, reluctant wife of a small-time Arkansas sheriff, who runs away from the security of marriage to become part of the great Western adventure...<br> -- Blue Duck, the sinister Indian renegade, one of the most frightening villains in American fiction, whose steely capacity for cruelty affects the lives of everyone in the book...<br> -- Newt, the young cowboy for whom the long and dangerous journey from Texas to Montana is in fact a search for his own identity...<br> -- Jake, the dashing, womanizing exRanger, a comrade-in-arms of Gus and Call, whose weakness leads him to an unexpected fate...<br> -- July Johnson, husband of Elmira, whose love for her draws him out of his secure life into the wilderness, and turns him into a kind of hero... <br> <i>Lonesome Dove</i> sweeps from the Rio Grande (where Gus and Call acquire the cattle for their long drive by raiding the Mexicans) to the Montana highlands (where they find themselves besieged by the last, defiant remnants of an older West). <br> It is an epic of love, heroism, loyalty, honor, and betrayal -- faultlessly written, unfailingly dramatic. <i>Lonesome Dove</i> is the novel about the West that American literature -- and the American reader -- has long been waiting for.</p><p>Larry McMurtry, in books like The Last Picture Show, has depicted the modern degeneration of the myth of the American West. The subject of <b>Lonesome Dove</b>, cowboys herding cattle on a great trail-drive, seems like the very stuff of that cliched myth, but McMurtry bravely tackles the task of creating meaningful literature out of it. At first the novel seems the kind of anti-mythic, anti-heroic story one might expect: the main protagonists are a drunken and inarticulate pair of former Texas Rangers turned horse rustlers. Yet when the trail begins, the story picks up an energy and a drive that makes heroes of these men. Their mission may be historically insignificant, or pointless--McMurtry is smart enough to address both possibilities--but there is an undoubted valor in their lives. The result is a historically aware, intelligent, romantic novel of the mythic west that won the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.Larry McMurtry is the author of twenty-nine novels, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, three memoirs, two collections of essays, and more than thirty screenplays.

His English publisher had excised many of the Scottish words and phrases he had used to evoke the suspense of the novel. From simple misreadings to deliberate revisions, subsequent printed editions represented major departures from Stevenson&#39;s handwritten text. Now Barry Menikoff has restored the author&#39;s language and punctuation, as well as the authentic Scots quality of his diction. In doing so, he has given readers a clearer picture of both Stevenson&#39;s skill as a storyteller and the novel&#39;s social and political context.For the better part of a century &#34;Kidnapped&#34; has occupied an ambiguous position in literary and cultural studies. Its initial appearance in a weekly magazine called &#34;Young Folks Paper,&#34; along with Stevenson&#39;s disingenuous comment that the novel had a diverting rather than a serious aim, have in effect trapped the book in the never-neverland of children&#39;s literature. Yet it is universally acknowledges as a classic of world literature and the novelist always considered it his finest achievement -- taken together with its sequel, &#34;David Balfour,&#34; the best he was capable of in fiction. Now, for the first readers can plainly see why Stevenson placed his story of David Balfour on so high a pedestal. Drawing on the unique autograph manuscript in California&#39;s Huntington Library, Professor Barry Menikoff faithfully reproduces the text as Stevenson originally wrote it, restoring the punctuation (of which the novelist was a master) and recovering the distinctive and often singular language that had been altered or deleted. The effect is to deepen and illuminate the Scottish texture of the novel. For a book so embedded in Scottish history as &#34;Kidnapped,&#34; so revelatory of its fierce loyalties and violent enmities, the discovery that Stevenson was even more nationalistic than we had known comes at an opportune moment, with the opening of the new Scottish parliament. This handsome new edition of a novel whose avowed purpose was the recovery of an important part of Scots history reproduces for the first time the original drawings that accompanied the text during its serialization in &#34;Young Folks.&#34; Professor Menikoff&#39;s substantial introduction situates the book in its cultural context, and enables us to see why Stevenson&#39;s contemporaries were both entranced and awed by his achievement. And in his extensive notes to the novel he reveals Stevenson&#39;s enormous prestige as an authority on language, both English and Scots, for &#34;Kidnapped&#34; was widely drawn upon as a reference by lexicographers for the &#34;Oxford English Dictionary&#34; and the &#34;Scottish National Dictionary.&#34; Finally, for a tale that charts the &#34;wanderings&#34; of David Balfour over the land and seas of Scotland, this edition is the first to provide a gazetteer of place-names encountered during the course of those travels.</p><h2>Illustrating Fashion : Concept to Creation</h2><p>A step-by-step guide on how to draw the basic fashion figure and render garments and<br>the elements of a garment while at the same time maintain spontaneity and excitement.<br>Author and noted illustrator Steven Stipelman helps the student understand a specific<br>concept, the designer, and the garment s place in the history of fashion.

The major shifts in global politics that came about with the dismantling of the Eastern bloc have left the United States unchallenged as the preeminent military power, but American economic might has declined drastically in the face of competition, first from Germany and Japan ad more recently from newly prosperous countries elsewhere. In <i>Deterring Democracy</i>, the impassioned dissident intellectual Noam Chomsky points to the potentially catastrophic consequences of this new imbalance. Chomsky reveals a world in which the United States exploits its advantage ruthlessly to enforce its national interests--and in the process destroys weaker nations. The new world order (in which the New World give the orders) has arrived.</p></p><p><p><b>Noam Chomsky</b>, the Ferrai P.

To answer this question, we have to begin by clarifying what the Cold War has been. There are two ways to approach this prior question. One is simply to accept the conventional interpretation; the second is to look at the historical facts. As is often the case, the two approaches yield rather different answers. 1. The Cold War as Ideological Construct According to the conventional understanding, the Cold War has been a confrontation between two superpowers. We then find several variants. The orthodox version, which is overwhelmingly dominant, holds that the driving factor in the Cold War has been virulent Soviet aggressiveness, which the United States sought to contain. On one side of the conflict, we have a "nightmare," on the other, the "defender of freedom," to borrow the terms of the ultra-right John Birch Society, right-wing fundamentalist preachers, and liberal American intellectuals, who responded with awe and acclaim when these words were used by V�clav Havel in addressing Congress in 1990.1 A critical variant argues that the perception of a Soviet threat was exaggerated;the dangers were less extreme than we thought. US policies, while noble in intent, were based on misunderstanding and analytic error. A still sharper critique holds that the superpower confrontation resulted from an interaction in which the United States also played a role (for some analysts, a major role) and that the contrast is not simply one of nightmare versus defense of freedom, but is more complex--in Central America and the Caribbean, for example. According to all variants, the essential doctrines guiding US policy have been containment and deterrence, or, more ambitiously, "rollback." And the Cold War is now at an end, with the capitulation of one antagonist--the aggressor throughout, according to the orthodox version. The orthodox version is sketched in stark and vivid terms in what is widely recognized to be the basic US Cold War document, NSC 68 in April 1950, shortly before the Korean War, announcing that "the cold war is in fact a real war in which the survival of the free world is at stake."2 It merits attention, both as an early expression of the conventional understanding in its orthodox variant and for insights into historical realities that lie beyond these ideological constructs. The basic structure of the argument has the childlike simplicity of a fairy tale. There are two forces in the world, at "opposite poles." In one corner we have absolute evil; in the other, sublimity. There can be no compromise between them. The diabolical force, by its very nature, must seek total domination of the world. Therefore it must be overcome, uprooted, and eliminated so that the virtuous champion of all that is good may survive to perform his exalted works. The "fundamental design of the Kremlin," NSC 68 author Paul Nitze explains, is "the complete subversion or forcible destruction of the machinery of government and structure of society" in every corner of the world that is not yet "subservient to and controlled from the Kremlin." "The implacable purpose of the slave state [is] to eliminate the challenge of freedom" everywhere. The "compulsion" of the Kremlin "demands total power over all men" in the slave state itself, and "absolute authority over the rest of the world." The force of evil is "inescapably militant," so that no accommodation or peaceful settlement is even thinkable. In contrast, the "fundamental purpose of the United States" is "to assure the integrity and vitality of our free society, which is founded upon the dignity and worth of the individual," and to safeguard these values throughout the world. Our free society is marked by "marvelous diversity," "deep tolerance," "lawfulness," a commitment "to create and maintain an environmentin which every individual has the opportunity to realize his creative powers." It "does not fear, it welcomes, diversity" and "derives its strength from its hospitality even to antipathetic ideas." The "system of values which animates our society" includes "the principles of freedom, tolerance, the importance of the individual and the supremacy of reason over will." "The essential tolerance of our world outlook, our generous and constructive impulses, and the absence of covetousness in our international relations are assets of potentially enormous influence," particularly among those who who have been lucky enough to experience these qualities at first hand, as in Latin America, which has benefited so much from "our long continuing endeavors to create and now develop the Inter-American system." The conflict between the forces of light and darkness is "momentous, involving the fulfillment or destruction not only of this Republic but of civilization itself." "The assault on free institutions is world-wide," and "imposes on us, in our own interests, the responsibility of world leadership." We must seek "to foster a world environment in which the American system can survive and flourish." Since "a defeat of free institutions anywhere is a defeat everywhere," no corner of the world, however tiny and insignificant, can escape our ministrations. And surely "the idea that Germany or Japan or other important areas can exist as islands of neutrality in a divided world is unreal, given the Kremlin design for world domination." Five years after the USSR was virtually annihilated by the Axis powers, they must be reconstituted within a US-dominated alliance committed to the final elimination of the Soviet system that they failed to destroy. Given that "the integrity and vitality of our system is in greater jeopardy than ever before in our history," even in the darkest days of the War of Independence or when British troops captured Washington in 1814, it is clear that serious measures are in order; in fact, military spending nearly quadrupled shortly after, on the pretext that the invasion of South Korea was the first step in the Kremlin conquest of the world--despite the lack of compelling evidence, then or now, for Russian initiative in this phase of the complex struggle over the fate of Korea. The memorandum calls for a huge increase in armaments, while recognizing that the slave state was far weaker than the champion of freedom by any measure. Relevant data are presented in such a way as to obscure direct comparisons and selected to exaggerate the enemy's strength, the standard pattern throughout the Cold War era.3 Nevertheless, even the data presented show the US military budget to be double that of the USSR and its economic power four times as great, while in this early stage of rebuilding their farmore powerful economies, the European allies alone already matched the Soviet Union along with its satellites. Despite the disparity between the two opposite poles in economic level and military force, the slave state has enormous advantages. Being so backward, it "can do more with less"; its weakness is its strength, the ultimate weapon. It is both midget and superman, far behind us by every measure but with "a formidable capacity to act with the widest tactical latitude, with stealth and speed," with "extraordinary flexibility," a highly effective military machine and "great coercive power." Another problem is that the evil enemy finds a "receptive audience ... in the free world," particularly Asia. To defend Europe and protect the freedom that has traditionally reigned in Africa, Asia, and Latin America from the "Kremlin design," we must therefore vastly increase military spending and adopt a strategy aimed at the break-up and collapse of the Soviet Union. Our military forces are "dangerously inadequate," because our responsibility is world control; in contrast, the far weaker Soviet military forces greatly exceed their limited defensive needs. Nothing that had happened in the past years suggested that the USSR might face some security problems, in contrast to us, with our vulnerability to powerful enemies everywhere. We need vast military forces "not only for protection against disaster but also to support our foreign policy," though for public relations purposes, "emphasis should be given to the essentially defensive character" of the military build-up. Public relations aside, our actual stance must be aggressive in "the conflict which has been imposed upon us." "Given the Kremlin design for world domination," a necessary feature of the slave state, we cannot accept the existence of the enemy but must "foster the seeds of destruction within the Soviet system" and "hasten [its] decay" by all means short of war (which is too dangerous for us). We must avoid negotiations, except as a device to placate public opinion, because any agreements "would reflect present realities and would therefore be unacceptable, if not disastrous, to the United States and the rest of the free world," though after the success of a "rollback" strategy we may "negotiate a settlement with the Soviet Union (or a successor state or states)." To achieve these essential goals, we must overcome weaknesses in our society, such as "the excesses of a permanently open mind," "the excess of tolerance," and "dissent among us." We will have to learn to "distinguish between the necessity for tolerance and the necessity for just suppression," a crucial feature of "the democratic way." It is particularly important toinsulate our "labor unions, civic enterprises, schools, churches, and all media for influencing opinion" from the "evil work" of the Kremlin, which seeks to subvert them and "make them sources of confusion in our economy, our culture and our body politic." Increased taxes are also necessary, along with "Reduction of Federal expenditures for purposes other than defense and foreign assistance, if necessary by the deferment of certain desirable programs." These military Keynesian policies, it is suggested, are likely to stimulate the domestic economy as well. Indeed, they may serve to prevent "a decline in economic activity of serious proportions." "A large measure of sacrifice and discipline will be demanded of the American people," and they also must "give up some of the benefits" they enjoy as we assume the mantle of world leadership and overcome the economic recession, already in progress, by "positive governmental programs" to subsidize advanced industry through the military system. Notice that the noble purpose of the free society and the evil design of the slave state are innate properties, which derive from their very nature. Hence the actual historical and documentary record is not relevant to assessing the validity of these doctrines. Accordingly, it is unfair to criticize the memorandum on the grounds that no evidence is presented to support its conclusions, and to question such locutions as "it is apparent from the preceding sections," or "it has been shown above," on the same grounds. As a matter of logic, no empirical evidence is required; pure thought suffices to establish the required truths. In public discourse the same conceptions reigned, and still do. A characteristic expression of the conventional understanding is given by William Hyland, editor of <i>Foreign Affairs,</i> in the lead article of the Spring 1990 issue: For the past fifty years American foreign policy has been formed in response to the threat posed by this country's opponents and enemies. In virtually every year since Pearl Harbor, the United States has been engaged either in war or in confrontation. Now, for the first time in half a century, the United States has the opportunity to reconstruct its foreign policy free of most of the constraints and pressures of the Cold War ... . Since 1941 the United States has been fully entangled. Now as we move into a new era, a yearning for American nonentanglement may be returning in various guises ... . Can America at long last come home? ... The United States does in fact enjoy the luxury of some genuine choices for the first time since 1945. America and its allies have won the Cold War ... Thus, we had no "genuine choices" when we invaded South Vietnam,overthrew the democratic capitalist government of Guatemala in 1954 and have maintained the rule of murderous gangsters ever since, ran by far the most extensive international terror operations in history against Cuba from the early 1960s and Nicaragua through the 1980s, sought to assassinate Lumumba and installed and maintained the brutal and corrupt Mobutu dictatorship, backed Trujillo, Somoza, Marcos, Duvalier, the generals of the southern cone, Suharto, the racist rulers of southern Africa, and a whole host of other major criminals; and on, and on. We could do nothing else, given the threat to our existence. But now the enemy has retreated, so we can perhaps satisfy our "yearning for nonentanglement" in the affairs of others; though, as others add, our "yearning for democracy"4 may yet impel us to persist in our noble endeavors in defense of freedom. With choices available for the first time, we can turn to constructive programs for the Third World (as liberal humanists urge) or leave the undeserving poor to wallow in their misery (the conservative position). Expressing the more caring liberal view, Thomas Schoenbaum, executive director of the Dean Rusk Center of International and Comparative Law at the University of Georgia, calls for "more finely tuned and differentiated policies" in the "complex and heterogeneous areas" of the Third World. Constrained by the overwhelming imperative of resisting Soviet aggression throughout the world, we have been unable to develop such policies. But now, perhaps, we have reached "the end of the Cold War--and the good guys won." We may therefore hope that the Soviets will "mute their longstanding campaign to support communist revolutions and totalitarian regimes in the Third World," so that "the U.S. may be able to abandon its traditional posture--that priority should be given to stopping communist expansion--and adopt more positive policies."5 In other respects too the public record conforms to the conventions of NSC 68. In particular, it is widely recognized that the very existence of the Soviet Union constitutes aggression. Diplomatic historian John Lewis Gaddis, one of the most respected figures of liberal scholarship on the Cold War, explains that the allied intervention immediately after the Bolshevik revolution was defensive in nature, and for Woodrow Wilson, was inspired "above all else" by his fervent desire "to secure self-determination in Russia"--by forceful installation of the rulers we select. The invasion was defensive because it was "in response to a profound and potentially far-reaching intervention by the new Soviet government in the internal affairs, not just of the West, but of virtually every country in the world," namely, "the Revolution's challenge--which could hardly have been more categorical--tothe very survival of the capitalist order." "The security of the United Stat...</p><h2>Can You Count to a Googol? (Wells of Knowledge Science Series)</h2><p>You may be able to count all the way to one hundred, but have you ever counted to a googol? It&#39;s impossible! In this fun book of numbers, Robert E. Wells explores the wonderful world of zeros and tells how the googol came to be named.</p><p>Robert E. Wells is an Albert Whitman author.Grade 2-4-The author illustrates how our number system builds by powers of 10 and helps develop a concept of what those numbers mean. The initial illustrations are silly: a girl balances one banana on her nose; a monkey balances 10 bananas using limbs and tail; 100 eagles pull a basket of children through the sky. A more realistic sequence illustrates millions to billions. A large wooden crate is loaded with 1,000,000 dollar bills; 10 of these crates are loaded onto a flatbed trailer (10 x $1,000,000 or $10,000,000); 10 of the trailers are loaded onto a barge ($100,000,000); and a harbor is filled with 10 barges ($1,000,000,000). The author explains that a googol, the number with 100 zeros, is too big to illustrate. "If you counted every grain of sand on all the worlds' beaches, and every drop of water in all the oceans, that wouldn't even be CLOSE to a GOOGOL." Children are reminded that numbers go on forever by a rocket speeding off into space, accompanied by a trail of zeros. The switch from fanciful to factual in these examples is somewhat jarring, but the pen-and-acrylic cartoons do adequately illustrate the growing numbers. Though David M. Schwartz's How Much Is a Million? (Lothrop, 1985), with its consistent playful tone and imaginative number illustrations, is still a preferable choice, Wells's model of building numbers could be a useful addition.<br><i>Adele Greenlee, Bethel College, St. Paul, MN </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>An Introduction to Child Development (SAGE Foundations of Psychology series)</h2><p><p><em>An Introduction to Child Development, Third Edition</em><em>&nbsp;</em>provides undergraduate students in psychology and other disciplines with a comprehensive survey of the main areas of child development, from infancy through to adolescence, in a readily accessible format.

And during those four decades, his wide knowledge, keen judgment, prodigious energy, and sharp sense of humor have made him America&#x2019;s most celebrated film critic. He was the first such critic to win a Pulitzer Prize&#x2014;one of just three film critics ever to receive that honor&#x2014;and the only one to have a star dedicated to him on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. His groundbreaking hit TV show, <i>At the Movies</i>, meanwhile, has made &#x201c;two thumbs up&#x201d; one of the most coveted hallmarks in the entire industry.&nbsp;<br><br>No critic alive has reviewed more movies than Roger Ebert, and yet his essential writings have never been collected in a single volume&#x2014;until now. With <i>Awake in the Dark</i>, both fans and film buffs can finally bask in the best of Ebert&#x2019;s work. The reviews, interviews, and essays collected here present a picture of this indispensable critic&#x2019;s numerous contributions to the cinema and cinephilia. From <i>The Godfather</i> to <i>GoodFellas</i>, from <i>Cries and Whispers</i> to <i>Crash</i>, the reviews in <i>Awake in the Dark</i> span some of the most exceptional periods in film history, from the dramatic rise of rebel Hollywood and the heyday of the auteur, to the triumph of blockbuster films such as <i>Star Wars </i>and <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>, to the indie revolution that is still with us today.&nbsp;<br><br>The extraordinary interviews gathered in <i>Awake in the Dark</i> capture Ebert engaging not only some of the most influential directors of our time&#x2014;Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Woody Allen, Robert Altman, Werner Herzog, and Ingmar Bergman&#x2014;but also some of the silver screen&#x2019;s most respected and dynamic personalities, including actors as diverse as Robert Mitchum, James Stewart, Warren Beatty, and Meryl Streep. Ebert&#x2019;s remarkable essays play a significant part in <i>Awake in the Dark</i> as well. The book contains some of Ebert&#x2019;s most admired pieces, among them a moving appreciation of John Cassavetes and a loving tribute to the virtues of black-and-white films.&nbsp;<br><br>If Pauline Kael and Andrew Sarris were godmother and godfather to the movie generation, then Ebert is its voice from within&#x2014;a writer whose exceptional intelligence and daily bursts of insight and enthusiasm have shaped the way we think about the movies. <i>Awake in the Dark</i>, therefore, will be a treasure trove not just for fans of this seminal critic, but for anyone desiring a fascinating and compulsively readable chronicle of film since the late 1960s.<br><br></p></p><p><b>Roger Ebert</b> is the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning film critic of the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> and has cohosted a weekly movie review program on television since 1975, first with Gene Siskel and since 2000 with Richard Roeper.

Here, in such famous stories as "Bartleby, the Scrivener" and "The Encantadas, or Enchanted Isles," we find Melville's imagination and style at its best. Of the less well known tales, the humor in "The Piazza" and "The Lightning-Rod Man," and the gothic horror of "The Bell Tower," command attention as well.

He is best known for his novel Moby-Dick. His first three books gained much contemporary attention (the first, Typee, becoming a bestseller), and after a fast-blooming literary success in the late 1840s, his popularity declined precipitously in the mid-1850s and never recovered during his lifetime. When he died in 1891, he was almost completely forgotten. It was not until the "Melville Revival" in the early 20th century that his work won recognition, especially Moby-Dick, which was hailed as one of the literary masterpieces of both American and world literature. He was the first writer to have his works collected and published by the Library of America.</p></p><h2>Crete The Battle And The Resistance</h2><p>This book recounts the fall of Greece, the invasion of Crete by the Germans and the Resistance. The book is based on interviews with both the Allies and the Germans who took part. It gives insights into the invasion from the air and explains how Ultra intelligence played a key role. It also reveals how General Freyberg actually misinterpreted German coded messages to devastating effects.</p><p>Antony Beevor is the author of Crete: The Battle and the Resistance (Runciman Prize), Stalingrad (Samuel Johnson Prize, Wolfson Prize for History and Hawthornden Prize), Berlin: The Downfall, The Battle for Spain (Premio La Vanguardia), D-Day: The Battle for Normandy (Prix Henry Malherbe and the RUSI Westminster Medal), The Second World War, and Ardennes 1944 (Prix Medicis shortlist). The number one bestselling historian in Britain, Beevor&#39;s books have appeared in thirty-two languages and have sold just over seven million copies. A former chairman of the Society of Authors, he has received a number of honorary doctorates. He is also a visiting professor at the University of Kent and an Honorary Fellow of King&#39;s College, London. He was knighted in 2017.Few battles in World War II can surpass Crete for high drama, both on land and sea. Beevor, formerly of the 11th Hussars, writes about that battle with a soldier's eye and a historian's insight. Crete was a campaign unique in many respects, not the least of which was its ferocity. Beevor has a flair for re-creating the historical moment, and during sections of the text even the most detached reader will pause to catch a breath. He dissects the leadership of some of the war's most intriguing personalities, both Allied and German, illuminating their achievements and follies. His book is enriched with wonderful anecdotal material, some of which will both amuse and puzzle his American counterparts, whose military traditions are often so dissimilar.

A native of South Carolina and son of Henry Laurens, president of the Continental Congress, John devoted his life to securing American independence.In this comprehensive biography, Gregory D. Massey recounts the young Laurens's wartime record &#x2015;a riveting tale in its own right &#x2015;and finds that even more remarkable than his military escapades were his revolutionary ideas concerning the rights of African Americans.<b>Massey relates Laurens's desperation to fight for his country once revolution had begun. A law student in England, he joined the war effort in 1777, leaving behind his English wife and an unborn child he would never see. Massey tells of the young officer's devoted service as General George Washington's aide-de-camp, interaction with prominent military and political figures, and conspicuous military efforts at Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, Newport, Charleston, Savannah, and Yorktown. Massey also recounts Laurens's survival of four battle wounds and six months as a prisoner of war, his controversial diplomatic mission to France, and his close friendship with Alexander Hamilton. Laurens's death in a minor battle in August 1782 was a tragic loss for the new state and nation. Unlike other prominent southerners, Laurens believed blacks shared a similar nature with whites, and he formulated a plan to free slaves in return for their service in the Continental Army. Massey explores the personal, social, and cultural factors that prompted Laurens to diverge so radically from his peers and to raise vital questions about the role African Americans would play in the new republic.</b></p><p>Gregory D.

These images represent some of the best of his thirty-year career, and here he reflects on the subtle elements that make his art so powerful.The splendid photography in Extreme Nature is the result of a profound sensitivity to the aquatic environment. &#34;I worship the single-minded effort that still photography embodies,&#34; Curtsinger says, &#34;the challenge, the solitary immersion in an animal&#39;s world and the rewards that are often found in such an adventure.&#34; The reader accompanies him on these adventures, plumbing the depths around icebergs and volcanoes, meeting sharks, sea turtles, seals, narwhals, whales, and many others along the way.

Novel elements of the approach include the immediate inference of Maxwell's equations from Coulomb's law and (Galilean) relativity, the use of action and stationary principles, the central role of Green's functions both in statics and dynamics, and, throughout, the integration of mathematics and physics. Thus, physical problems in electrostatics are used to develop the properties of Bessel functions and spherical harmonics. The latter portion of the book is devoted to radiation, with rather complete treatments of synchrotron radiation and diffraction, and the formulation of the mode decomposition for waveguides and scattering. Consequently, the book provides the student with a thorough grounding in electrodynamics in particular, and in classical field theory in general, subjects with enormous practical applications, and which are essential prerequisites for the study of quantum field theory.An essential resource for both physicists and their students, the book includes a &#x201d;Reader's Guide,&#x201d; which describes the major themes in each chapter, suggests a possible path through the book, and identifies topics for inclusion in, and exclusion from, a given course, depending on the instructor's preference. Carefully constructed problems complement the material of the text, and introduce new topics. The book should be of great value to all physicists, from first-year graduate students to senior researchers, and to all those interested in electrodynamics, field theory, and mathematical physics.The text for the graduate classical electrodynamics course was left unfinished upon Julian Schwinger's death in 1994, but was completed by his coauthors, who have brilliantly recreated the excitement of Schwinger's novel approach.</p><p>&#34;The late Julian Schwinger shared the 1965 Nobel Prize for Physics with Richard Feynman and Sin-ltiro Tomonaga for their work on the theory of quantum electrodynamics.

The social, economic and political institutions of the African continent were designed to ensure survival and maximize numbers, but in the context of medical progress and other twentieth-century innovations these institutions have bred the most rapid population growth the world has ever seen. The history of the continent is thus a single story binding living Africans to the earliest human ancestors.</p><p>From the origins of mankind to the South African general election of 1994, this analysis of African history refocuses on the peopling of an environmentally hostile continent. It stresses the impact of medical progress and other twentieth century innovations on population growth.In a vast and all-embracing study of Africa, from the origins of mankind to the South African general election of 1994, John Iliffe refocuses African history on the peopling of an environmentally hostile continent. Africans have been pioneers struggling against disease and nature, and their social, economic and political institutions have been designed to ensure survival and maximise numbers. These institutions enabled them to survive the slave trade and colonial invasion, but in the context of medical progress and other twentieth-century innovations the same institutions have bred the most rapid population growth the world has ever seen. This demographic growth has lain behind the collapse of colonial rule, the disintegration of Apartheid, and the instability of contemporary nations. The history of the continent is thus a single story binding living Africans to their earliest human ancestors.</p><h2>Semiotics: The Basics</h2><p><p>This updated second edition provides a clear and concise introduction to the key concepts of semiotics in accessible and jargon-free language.

A confluence of cultural contributions created a bright, burning moment in history: it was the heyday of fashion icons such as Pucci, whose use of color, line, and superb craftsmanship set the standard for women&#x2019;s clothing for decades, and Brioni, whose confident and classy creations for men inspired the contemporary American suit. Rome&#x2019;s huge movie studio, Cinecitta, also known as &#x201c;Hollywood-on-the Tiber,&#x201d; attracted a dizzying array of stars from Charleton Heston, Gregory Peck, Audrey Hepburn, Ava Gardner, and Frank Sinatra to that stunning and combustible couple, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, who began their extramarital affair during the making of Cleopatra. And behind these stars trailed street photographers&#x2015;Tazio Secchiarioli, Pierluigi Praturlon, and Marcello Gepetti&#x2015;who searched, waited, and pounced on their subjects in pursuit of the most unflattering and dramatic portraits of fame.</p><p>Fashionistas, exiles, moguls, and martyrs flocked to Rome hoping for a chance to experience and indulge in the glow of old money, new stars, fast cars, wanton libidos, and brazen news photographers. The scene was captured nowhere better than in Federico Fellini&#x2019;s masterpiece, <em>La Dolce Vita</em>, starring Marcello Mastroianni and the Swedish bombshell Anita Ekberg. It was condemned for its licentiousness, when in fact Fellini was condemning the very excess, narcissism, and debauchery of Rome&#x2019;s bohemian scene.</p><p>Gossipy, colorful, and richly informed, <em>Dolce Vita Confidential</em> re-creates Rome&#x2019;s stunning ascent with vivid and compelling tales of its glitterati and artists, down to every last outrageous detail of the city&#x2019;s magnificent transformation.</p> 8 pages of photographs</p><p>Shawn Levy is a former film critic for The Oregonian and the best-selling author of Rat Pack Confidential and Paul Newman: A Life.

While many artists of his generation have used popular images to explore the cultural landscape, Wesley has employed comic strip style and compositional rigor to make deeply personal, often hermetic paintings that strike at the core of our most primal fears, joys and desires. In this first volume ever to collect the entire iconic <i>Bumstead</i> series, which spans from 1974 until the present, we are introduced to several paintings that have never been reproduced before. These are dark and erotic works, sly and witty without ever giving too much away. Linda Norden described them thus in <i>Parkett</i> 62: "The <i>Bumstead</i> paintings--whether detailing scenes of domestic misunderstanding, zooming in on off-camera moments of bafflement or simply scanning empty halls and walls for private memories--are excruciatingly specific representations of the gulfs between feeling and comprehension... smart, funny, startling, irreverently empathetic and often heartbreaking, they are a welcome antidote to more laborious discourse." With an insightful new essay by Robert Hobbs.</p><p>John Wesley (1703-1791), and 18th-century Anglican clergyman and Christian theologian, was an early leader in the Methodist movement. Wesley's greatest theological achievement was his promotion of what he termed "Christian perfection," or holiness of heart and life. <br> <br>Albert Cook Outler was Professor of Theology at the Southern Methodist University Perkins School of Theology in Dallas, Texas. He is generally considered to be one of the most important Wesley scholars in the history of the Church as well as the first real United Methodist theologian. He was also a key figure in the twentieth-century ecumenical movement."An excellent primer to the thought of John Wesley. Outler covers the important issues by selecting readings that express the core of Wesley's theology."--Neil D. Anderson, Asbury College<br><br>"A major book....It consists of selections from Wesley's writings designed in their arrangement to bring out his development, along with introductions and notes."--Review of Books and Religion<br><br>"A credit to its editor....The documents are well chosen; selections representative of the wide interest and preoccupation of Wesley are given to convey a picture of the stature of the man."--Journal of Religion<br><br>"Why it took me so long to discover this outstanding anthology, I do not know. It is marked by great learning from the editor, and genuine theological contribution from Wesley."--Mark A.

Lyrical, wise, compelling: the novels are a wonderful imaginative feat&#39; SARAH WATERS &#39;The Alexandriad is one of the twentieth century&#39;s most unexpectedly original works of art&#39; GORE VIDAL In the first novel of her stunning trilogy, Mary Renault vividly imagines the life of Alexander the Great, the charismatic leader whose drive and ambition created a legend. Alexander&#39;s beauty, strength and defiance were apparent from birth, but his boyhood honed those gifts into the makings of a king. His mother, Olympias, and his father, King Philip of Macedon, fought each other for their son&#39;s loyalty, teaching Alexander politics and vengeance from the cradle. His love for the youth Hephaistion taught him trust, while Aristotle&#39;s tutoring provoked his mind and Homer&#39;s Iliad fuelled his aspirations. Killing his first man in battle at the age of twelve, he became regent at sixteen and commander of Macedon&#39;s cavalry at eighteen, so that by the time his father was murdered, Alexander&#39;s skills had grown to match his fiery ambition. Shortlisted for the 1970 Lost Booker Prize &#39;This is not just a novel: it&#39;s also the best imagining we are ever likely to have of a man who tore up history. The language may seem a bit florid at first - a little too &#34;historical novel&#34; - but set all snobbery aside: this is wonderful, scholarly, top-flight stuff&#39; - Emily Wilson, Guardian &#39;The Alexander Trilogy stands as one of the most important works of fiction in the 20th century . . . it represents the pinnacle of [Renault&#39;s] career . . . Renault&#39;s skill is in immersing us in their world, drawing us into its strangeness, its violence and beauty. It&#39;s a literary conjuring trick like all historical fiction - it can only ever be an approximation of the truth. But in Renault&#39;s hands, the trick is so convincing and passionately conjured&#39; - Antonia Senior, The Times</p><p>Mary Renault (1905-1983) was born in London and educated at St Hughs, Oxford. She trained as a nurse at Oxford&#39;s Radcliffe Infirmary, where she met her lifelong partner, Julie Mullard. Her first novel, Purposes of Love, was published in 1937. In 1948, after North Face won a MGM prize worth $150,000, she and Mullard emigrated to South Africa. There, Renault was able to write forthrightly about homosexual relationships for the first time - in her masterpiece, The Charioteer (1953), and then in her first historical novel, The Last of the Wine (1956). Renault&#39;s vivid novels set in the ancient world brought her worldwide fame. In 2010 Fire From Heaven was shortlisted for the Lost Booker of 1970.The Alexander Trilogy stands as one of the most important works of fiction in the 20th century . . . it represents the pinnacle of [Renault&#39;s] career . . .

Lyrical, wise, compelling: the novels are a wonderful imaginative feat * Sarah Waters * Mary Renault is a shining light to both historical novelists and their readers.

Despite early stardom through his childhood role in the motion picture "Stand By Me", and growing up on television as Wesley Crusher on "Star Trek: The Next Generation", Wil left Hollywood in pursuit of happiness, purpose, and a viable means of paying the bills. In the oddest of places, Topeka, Kansas, Wil discovered that despite his claims to fame, he was at heart <i>Just a Geek</i>.<br><br>In this bestselling book, Wil shares his deeply personal and difficult journey to find himself. You'll understand the rigors, and joys, of Wil's rediscovering of himself, as he comes to terms with what it means to be famous, or, ironically, famous for once having been famous. Writing with honesty and disarming humanity, Wil touches on the frustrations associated with his acting career, his inability to distance himself from Ensign Crusher in the public's eyes, the launch of his incredibly successful web site, wilwheaton.net, and the joy he's found in writing. Through all of this, Wil shares the ups and downs he encountered along the journey, along with the support and love he discovered from his friends and family.<br><br>The stories in <i>Just a Geek</i> include:</p><p></p><ul><li>Wil's plunge from teen star to struggling actor</li><li>Discovering the joys of HTML, blogging, Linux, and web design</li><li>The struggle between Wesley Crusher, Starfleet ensign, and Wil Wheaton, author and blogger</li><li>Gut-wrenching reactions to the 9-11 disaster</li><li>Moving tales of Wil's relationships with his wife, step-children, and extended family</li><li>The transition from a B-list actor to an A-list author</li></ul><p>Wil Wheaton--celebrity, blogger, and geek--writes for the geek in all of us.

But with the rise of the sugar colonies in the New World over the following century, sugar became cheap, ubiquitous and an everyday necessity. Less than fifty years ago, few people suggested that sugar posed a global health problem.&nbsp; And yet today, sugar is regularly denounced as a dangerous addiction, on a par with tobacco. While sugar consumption remains higher than ever&#x2015;in some countries as high as 100lbs per head per year&#x2015;some advertisements even proudly proclaim that their product contains&nbsp;no&nbsp;sugar.</p><p>How did sugar grow from prize to pariah? Acclaimed historian James Walvin looks at the history of our collective sweet tooth, beginning with the sugar grown by enslaved people who had been uprooted and shipped vast distances to undertake the grueling labor on plantations.&nbsp; The combination of sugar and slavery would transform the tastes of the Western world.</p><p>Masterfully insightful and probing, James Walvin reveals the relationship between society and sweetness over the past two centuries&#x2015;and how it explains our conflicted relationship with sugar today. &nbsp;</p> 8 pages of B&amp;W photographs</p><p>James Walvin is the author of several books on slavery and modern social history, including Crossings and A Jamaican Plantation. He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and in 2008 was awarded an OBE for services to scholarship. He lives in England.&#x201c;A roller-coaster ride through 500 years of history. <em>Sugar</em> is an entertaining, informative and utterly depressing global history of an important commodity. By alerting readers to the ways that modernity&#x2019;s very origins are entangled with a seemingly benign and delicious substance, <em>Sugar</em> raises fundamental questions about our world.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Walvin&#x2019;s tone is brisk and informative, particularly in chapters on the gradual intertwining of sugar and sociability.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Walvin provides a concise and engaging overview of the history of sugar, exploring its societal and environmental impact from its presence in the human diet dating back millennia to its substantial role in the global obesity crisis.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This thoroughly researched exploration of a cherished commodity begins with sugar&#x2019;s roots in the Middle East and chronicles its dissemination via trade and colonialism. Walvin&#x2019;s expertise shines in his handling of the sugar economy.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something crazy about the modern relationship with sugar. We demonize it, and yet we can&#x2019;t seem to stop gorging on it. Few plants can have caused more human misery than sugar cane, first through slavery and now through obesity, tooth decay and Type 2 diabetes. Yet when we see something sugary&#x2015;a ball of cotton candy, some salted-caramel ice cream, a chocolate fudge cake&#x2015;most of us still react only with joy, as if greeting a dear old friend. Despite everything we now know about the harm caused by sugar&#x2015;and other modern sweeteners, such as high-fructose corn syrup&#x2015;it never stops being sweet. A brilliant and thought-provoking history of sugar and its ironies. Mr. Walvin writes with fresh and righteous shock.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Bee Wilson, The Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Shocking and revelatory.&nbsp; No other product has so changed the world, and no other book reveals the scale of its impact.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David Olusoga, author of The Kaiser&#x2019;s Holocaust and host of the BBC's "Civilization"</strong></p><h2>Rhetoric in Popular Culture</h2><p>The<strong> Fourth Edition</strong> of Barry Brummett&#x2019;s <strong>Rhetoric in Popular Culture</strong> provides readers with in-depth insight into the techniques of rhetorical criticism to analyze the full spectrum of contemporary issues in popular culture.

Over the last two decades, it has emerged as a powerful tool for solving crimes and determining guilt and innocence. But, very recently, an important new aspect of DNA has been revealed&#x2015;it contains a detailed record of evolution. That is, DNA is a living chronicle of how the marvelous creatures that inhabit our planet have adapted to its many environments, from the freezing waters of the Antarctic to the lush canopy of the rain forest.<br><br> In the pages of this highly readable narrative, Sean Carroll guides the general reader on a tour of the massive DNA record of three billion years of evolution to see how the fittest are made. And what a eye-opening tour it is&#x2015;one featuring immortal genes, fossil genes, and genes that bear the scars of past battles with horrible diseases. This book clinches the case for evolution, beyond any reasonable doubt. 50 black-and-white illustrations and 8 pages of color</p><p>Sean B. Carroll is professor of genetics at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison and investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. His first book, Endless Forms Most Beautiful, was a finalist for the 2005 Los Angeles Times Book Prize. Carroll&#x2019;s seminal scientific work has been featured in Time and The New Yorker. He lives in Madison, Wisconsin.In a modern coda to Darwins laws, Sean Carroll examines the evolutionary concept of the fittest. Although not intended for casual readers, the audiobook discusses in satisfying scientific detail the current knowledge of evolution on a molecular basis and labels it genomics. Narrator Patrick Lawlor picks just the right pace for such a weighty tome, leaving enough time for listeners to absorb great detail but not be narcotized. He never misses with the complex vocabulary and finds an agreeable tone to keep listener interest high. Those who know Lawlors other readings will again be amazed at his proficiency with the requirements of so many kinds of literature. An open mind will find the audiobook challenging and rewarding.

The unprecedented globalization of daily life that is a hallmark of our era has occurred in large measure through the spread of Western technological, economic, and political influences. From the sixteenth century onwards, the West has exerted vast influences throughout the globe for both good and ill, and today's global citizens live in the wake of that impact. It is the goal of this book to introduce its readers to the Western heritage, so that they may be better informed and more culturally sensitive citizens of the emerging global age. </p> <p> The attacks upon the mainland of the United States on September 11, 2001 and the events that have succeeded those attacks have concentrated the attention of teachers, students, and informed citizens upon the heritage and future of Western civilization as have no other events since the end of World War II. Whereas previously commentary about global civilization involved analysis of the spread of Western economic, technological, and political influences, such commentary now requires us to explain how the West has defined itself over many centuries and to think about how the West will articulate its core values as it confronts new and daunting challenges. </p> <p> Twenty years ago, the West defined itself mainly in terms of the East-West tensions associated with the Cold War. The West is now in the process of defining itself in terms of global rivalries arising from conflict with political groups that are not identical with nation states and that define themselves in terms of opposition to what they understand the West to be. We have thus entered a new era in which citizens of the West need to understand how their culture, values, economy, and political outlooks have emerged. They cannot leave it to those who would attack the West to define Western civilization or to articulate its values. </p> <p> Since <i>The Western Heritage</i> first appeared, we have sought to provide our readers with a work that does justice to the richness and variety of Western civilization. We hope that such an understanding of the West will foster lively debate about its character, values, institutions, and global influence. Indeed, we believe such a critical outlook on their own culture has characterized the peoples of the West since its earliest history. Through such debates we define ourselves and the values of our culture. Consequently, we welcome the debate and hope that <i>The Western Heritage,</i> eighth edition, can help foster a genuinely informed discussion through its overview of Western civilization, the West's strengths and weaknesses, and the controversies surrounding Western history. </p> <p> Human beings make, experience, and record their history. In this edition as in past editions, our goal has been to present Western civilization fairly, accurately, and in a way that does justice to its great variety of human enterprise. History has many facets, no one of which alone can account for the others. Any attempt to tell the story of the West from a single overarching perspective, no matter how timely, is bound to neglect or suppress some important parts of that story. Like all authors of introductory texts, we have had to make choices, but we have attempted to provide the broadest possible introduction to Western civilization. To that end we hope that the many documents included in this book will allow the widest possible spectrum of people to give personal voice to their experiences over the centuries and will enable our readers to share that experience. </p> <p> We also believe that any book addressing the experience of the West must also look beyond its historical European borders. Students reading this book come from a wide variety of cultures and experiences. They live in a world of highly interconnected economies and instant communication between cultures. In this emerging multicultural society it seems both appropriate and necessary to recognize how Western civilization has throughout its history interacted with other cultures, both influencing and being influenced by them. Examples of this two-way interaction, such as that with Islam, appear throughout the text. To further highlight the theme of cultural interaction, <i>The Western Heritage</i> includes a series of comparative essays, The West &amp; the World. (For a fuller description, see below.) </p> <p><b>Goals of the Text</b></p> <p> Our primary goal has been to present a strong, clear, narrative account of the central developments in Western history. We have also sought to call attention to certain critical themes: </p> <ul> <li>The capacity of Western civilization from the time of the Greeks to the present to transform itself through self-criticism.</li> <li>The development in the West of political freedom, constitutional government, and concern for the rule of law and individual rights.</li> <li>The shifting relations among religion, society, and the state.</li> <li>The development of science and technology and their expanding impact on Western thought, social institutions, and everyday life.</li> <li>The major religious and intellectual currents that have shaped Western culture.</li> </ul> <p> We believe that these themes have been fundamental in Western civilization, shaping the past and exerting a continuing influence on the present. </p> <p> <b>Flexible Presentation.</b> <i>The Western Heritage,</i> eighth edition, is designed to accommodate a variety of approaches to a course in Western civilization, allowing teachers to stress what is most important to them. Some teachers will ask students to read all the chapters. Others will select among them to reinforce assigned readings and lectures. </p> <p> <b>Integrated Social, Cultural, and Political History.</b> <i>The Western Heritage</i> provides one of the richest accounts of the social history of the West available today, with strong coverage of family life, the changing roles of women, and the place of the family in relation to broader economic, political, and social developments. This coverage reflects the explosive growth in social historical research in the past three decades, which has enriched virtually all areas of historical study. In this edition we have again expanded both the breadth and depth of our coverage of social history through revisions of existing chapters, the addition of major new material and a new feature, Encountering the Past (see following), and the inclusion of new documents. </p> <p> While strongly believing in the study of the social experience of the West, we also share the conviction that internal and external political events have shaped the Western experience in fundamental and powerful ways. The experiences of Europeans in the twentieth century under fascism, national socialism, and communism demonstrate that influence, as has, more recently, the collapse of communism in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. We have also been told repeatedly by teachers that no matter what their own historical specialization, they believe that a political narrative gives students an effective tool to begin to understand the past. Consequently, we have sought to integrate the political with the social, cultural, and intellectual. </p> <p> No other survey text presents so full an account of the religious and intellectual development of the West. People may be political and social beings, but they are also reasoning and spiritual beings. What they think and believe are among the most important things we can know about them. Their ideas about God, society, law, gender, human nature, and the physical world have changed over the centuries and continue to change. We cannot fully grasp our own approach to the world without understanding the intellectual currents of the past and how they influenced our thoughts and conceptual categories. </p> <p> <b>Clarity and Accessibility.</b> Good narrative history requires clear, vigorous prose. As in earlier editions, we have paid careful attention to our writing, subjecting every paragraph to critical scrutiny. Our goal was to make the history of the West accessible to students without compromising vocabulary or conceptual level. We hope this effort will benefit both teachers and students. </p> <p><b>The Eighth Edition</b></p> <p> <b>Encountering the Past.</b> As an important new feature of the eighth edition, each chapter now includes an essay on a significant issue of everyday life or popular culture. These essays explore a variety of subjects from ancient athletics and religious festivals to medieval games and diets to attitudes toward bathing and smoking in early modern Europe to the politics of rock music in the late twentieth century. These thirty-one essays, each of which includes an illustration and study questions, expand <i>The Western Heritage's</i> rich coverage of social history. (See p. xxiii for a complete list of the Encountering the Past essays.) </p> <p> <b>Art &amp; The West.</b> In every chapter we highlight a work of art or architecture and discuss how it illuminates and reflects the artistic heritage of the West and the period in which the work was created. In Chapter 5, for example, a portrait of a young woman on the wall of a house in Pompeii and the accompanying essay provide a glimpse into the life of well-to-do women in the Roman Empire (p. 185/. In Chapter 11, the discussion of Lucas Cranach's wedding portraits of Martin Luther and his wife Katherine von Bora sheds light on a remarkable marriage in the age of the Reformation (p. 387/. In Chapter 16, paintings by Jean Baptiste Chardin and Elizabeth Vig...e-Lebrun illustrate domestic life and gender roles in eighteenth- century France (p. 548). In Chapters 30 and 31, paintings by the Soviet realist Tatjiana Yablonskaya and Jackson Pollock (pp. 1082-1083) and contemporary works by the British sculptor Rachel Whiteread /p. 1114) offer starkly contrasting comments on twentieth-century culture. Each essay includes questions for study and discussion.

Shiller, a respected expert on market volatility, offers an unconventional interpretation of recent U.S. stock market highs and shows that Alan Greenspan's term "irrational exuberance" is a good description of the mood behind the market. He warns that poorer performance may be in the offing and tells us how we--as a country and individually--can respond.</p><br><p>Shiller credits an unprecedented confluence of events with driving stocks to uncharted heights. He analyzes the structural and psychological factors that explain why the Dow Jones Industrial Average tripled between 1994 and 1999, a level of growth not reflected in any other sector of the economy. In contrast to many analysts, Shiller stresses circumstances that alter investors' perceptions of the market. These include the entry of the Internet into American homes, the misimpression that the aging of the baby-boom generation builds long-term protection into the market, and herd behavior, such as day-trading. He also examines cultural factors, including sports-style media coverage of the Dow's ups and downs and "new era" thinking about the economy. He considers--and challenges--efforts to rationalize exuberance that are based on either efficient-markets theory, narrowly construed, or the claim that investors have only recently learned the true value of the market.</p><br><p>In the most controversial portion of the book, Shiller cautions that a market that is overvalued by historical standards is inherently precarious. Among his prescriptions is an urgent plea to immediately end what he argues are perilous schemes to privatize social security in favor of plans to reform it. He also argues that private pension plans that encourage many people to put their entire retirement funds in the stock market should be modified. And he calls on our savings and investment institutions to take more sensible account of emerging risk-management principles. Shiller's analysis is convincingly documented, and--regardless of the market's future behavior--his book will stand as an important elaboration of why stocks soared and what our investment alternatives are.</p><br><p><i>Irrational Exuberance</i> is a must-read for pension-plan sponsors and endowment managers in the United States and abroad. It will also be studied by investment advisers, policy makers, and anyone from Wall Street to Main Street who doesn't want to be caught sitting on the speculative bubble if (or when) it bursts.</p></p><p>CNBC, day trading, the Motley Fool, Silicon Investor--not since the 1920s has there been such an intense fascination with the U.S. stock market. For an increasing number of Americans, logging on to Yahoo! Finance is a habit more precious than that morning cup of joe (as thousands of SBUX and YHOO shareholders know too well). Yet while the market continues to go higher, many of us can't get Alan Greenspan's famous line out of our heads. In <i>Irrational Exuberance</i>, Yale economics professor Robert J. Shiller examines this public fascination with stocks and sees a combination of factors that have driven stocks higher, including the rise of the Internet, 401(k) plans, increased coverage by the popular media of financial news, overly optimistic cheerleading by analysts and other pundits, the decline of inflation, and the rise of the mutual fund industry. He writes: "Perceived long-term risk is down.... Emotions and heightened attention to the market create a desire to get into the game. Such is irrational exuberance today in the United States."<p> By history's yardstick, Shiller believes this market is grossly overvalued, and the factors that have conspired to create and amplify this event--the baby-boom effect, the public infatuation with the Internet, and media interest--will most certainly abate. He fears that too many individuals and institutions have come to view stocks as their only investment vehicle, and that investors should consider looking beyond stocks as a way to diversify and hedge against the inevitable downturn. This is a serious and well-researched book that should read like a Stephen King novel to anyone who has staked his or her future on the market's continued success. --<i>Harry C. Edwards</i></p><p>"This is an excellent book by a distinguished scholar. It raises an issue of the utmost importance for the U.S. economy and presents a persuasive case that the U.S. stock market may be significantly overvalued. It is well written for a popular as well as a professional readership."<b>--Michael Brennan, Anderson School of Management, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p></p><h2>John Keats</h2><p><p>The life of Keats provides a unique opportunity for the study of literary greatness and of what permits or encourages its development. Its interest is deeply human and moral, in the most capacious sense of the words. In this authoritative biography--the first full-length life of Keats in almost forty years--the man and the poet are portrayed with rare insight and sympathy. In spite of a scarcity of factual data for his early years, the materials for Keats's life are nevertheless unusually full. Since most of his early poetry has survived, his artistic development can be observed more closely than is possible with most writers; and there are times during the period of his greatest creativity when his personal as well as his artistic life can be followed week by week.</p><p>The development of Keats's poetic craftsmanship proceeds simultaneously with the steady growth of qualities of mind and character. Mr. Bate has been concerned to show the organic relationship between the poet's art and his larger, more broadly humane development. Keats's great personal appeal--his spontaneity, vigor, playfulness, and affection--are movingly recreated; at the same time, his valiant attempt to solve the problem faced by all modern poets when they attempt to achieve originality and amplitude in the presence of their great artistic heritage is perceptively presented.</p><p>In discussing this matter, Mr. Bate says, "The pressure of this anxiety and the variety of reactions to it constitute one of the great unexplored factors in the history of the arts since 1750. And in no major poet, near the beginning of the modern era, is this problem met more directly than it is in Keats. The way in which Keats was somehow able, after the age of twenty-two, to confront this dilemma, and to transcend it, has fascinated every major poet who has used the English language since Keats's death and also every major critic since the Victorian era."</p><p>Mr. Bate has availed himself of all new biographical materials, published and unpublished, and has used them selectively and without ostentation, concentrating on the things that were meaningful to Keats. Similarly, his discussions of the poetry are not buried beneath the controversies of previous critics. He approaches the poems freshly and directly, showing their relation to Keats's experience and emotions, to premises and values already explored in the biographical narrative. The result is a book of many dimensions, not a restricted critical or biographical study but a fully integrated whole.,</p></p><p>The life of Keats provides a unique opportunity for the study of literary greatness and of what permits or encourages its development.Walter Jackson Bate was Abbott Lawrence Lowell Professor of the Humanities at Harvard University.

There is only a tangle of norms and mechanisms through which THEY hold together the scattered tatters of the global biopolitical fabric, through which THEY prevent its violent disintegration. Empire is the administrator of this desolation, the supreme manager of a process of listless implosion.&#x2015;from Introduction to Civil War Society is not in crisis, society is at an end. The things we used to take for granted have all been vaporized. Politics was one of these things, a Greek invention that condenses around an equation: to hold a position means to take sides, and to take sides means to unleash civil war. Civil war, position, sides&#x2015;these were all one word in the Greek: stasis. If the history of the modern state in all its forms&#x2015;absolute, liberal, welfare&#x2015;has been the continuous attempt to ward off this stasis, the great novelty of contemporary imperial power is its embrace of civil war as a technique of governance and disorder as a means of maintaining control. Where the modern state was founded on the institution of the law and its constellation of divisions, exclusions, and repressions, imperial power has replaced them with a network of norms and apparatuses that conspire in the production of the biopolitical citizens of Empire. In their first book available in English, Tiqqun explores the possibility of a new practice of communism, finding a foundation for an ontology of the common in the politics of friendship and the free play of forms-of-life. They see the ruins of society as the ideal setting for the construction of the community to come. In other words: the situation is excellent. Now is not the time to lose courage.</p></p><p>Tiqqun is a French collective of authors and activists formed in 1999. The group published two journal volumes in 1999 and 2001 (in which the collective author &#x201c;The Invisible Committee&#x201d; first appeared) as well as the books <i>Introduction to Civil War</i>, <i>Preliminary Materials for a Theory of the Young-Girl</i>, and <i>This Is Not a Program</i> (all published by Semiotext(e)).<br><br>Alexander R.

You meet a souvenir hunter in the Thirtieth Century and a schoolgirl who tries to cope with the teaching methods of the Twenty-second Century.

The school was the first to implement mass art and technology education, which was seen as essential to the Soviet Union&#x2019;s dominant modernist paradigm.<br><br> With <i>Avant-Garde as Method,</i> architect and historian Anna Bokov explores the nature of art and technology education in the Soviet Union. The pedagogical program at Vkhutemas, she shows, combined longstanding academic ideas and practices with more nascent industrial era ones to initiate a new type of pedagogy that took an explorative approach and drew its strength from continuous feedback and exchange between students and educators. Elaborating on the ways the Vkhutemas curriculum challenged established canons of academic tradition by replacing it with open-ended inquiry, Bokov then shows how this came to be articulated in architectural and urban projects within the school&#x2019;s advanced studios.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Anna Bokov</b> is an architect and historian.

The conflicting ideals of international revolution and collective security came into being with Lenin and Wilson in 1918. Nationalism, tempered by the Balance of Power, dominated Europe in the intervening seventy years. Drawing on a wealth of diplomatic documents, A. J. P. Taylor examines the relations of the Great Powers, when Europe was still the centre of the world. Written in characteristically vigorous prose, this is a challenging and original diplomatic history, that also considers the political and economic forces which made continental war inevitable.</p><p>The fall of Metternich in the revolutions which swept Europe in 1848 heralded an era of unprecedented nationalism, which culminated in the collapse of the Habsburg, Romanov, and Hohenzollern dynasties at the end of the First World War. In the intervening seventy years which are the subject of this book, the boundaries of Europe changed dramatically from those established at Vienna in 1815: Cavour championed the cause of <i>Risorgimento</i> in Italy; Bismarck brought about the unification of Germany; while the Great Powers scrambled for a place in the sun in Africa. <p> In this, one of his most enduring works, A.J.P. Taylor shows how the changing balance of power determined the course of European History, during this, the last age when Europe was the centre of world history. Throughout, Taylor's narrative is so vivid that the book is as much a work of literature as a contribution to historical scholarship.</p> <p> A.J.P. Taylor was one of Britain's most respected and influential historians. His numerous publications include: <i>English History 1914-1945</i>, <i>Revolutions and Revolutionaries</i>, and <i>The Origins of the Second World War</i>. He died in 1990.</p>The late A. J. P.

It is a valuable contribution not just of film criticism but to a society in which the vital role of women is just beginning to emerge."&#x2014;<i>Christian Science Monitor</i><br><br>"Haskell is interested in women&#x2014;how they are used in movies, how they use movies, and how the parts they play function as projections and verifications of our myths about women's lot and woman's psyche and even, lately, women's lib."&#x2014;Jane Kramer, <i>Village Voice</i><br><br>"In examining the goddesses worshipped by an entire nation, Molly Haskell reveals a good deal about our national character and our most cherished sexual myths. . . . Concerned with the deeply ingrained belief of women's inferiority, she analyzes movies as a social product as well as a social arbiter, and she effectively demonstrates how women are encouraged to impose limitations on themselves by fashioning those selves after flickering shadows in a darkened auditorium&#x2014;sexual creatures who possess neither ability nor ambition beyond their bodies. . . . Both as an examination of film and as sociology, <i>From Reverence to Rape</i> is excellent."&#x2014;Harriet Kriegel, <i>The Nation</i></p><p>Biting, brilliant, and marvelously witty, <i>From Reverence to Rape</i> is the first and the last word on women in the movies--perhaps the best book ever written on the subject. Most feminist film critics produce work that conforms to the academic discipline of cultural studies. Haskell's groundbreaking statement (first published in 1974 but with an added chapter that updates her theme through the 1980s) is accessible, serious, and great fun because its primary source is Hollywood cinema itself. Haskell draws on her amazing knowledge and understanding of American film to comment witheringly upon the ways producers, directors, and critics from the 1920s and onward have treated women. Still, within the attack her passionate love of films and the women who appear in them shines through. For example, in a lovely passage on Greta Garbo, Haskell claims that the actress's appeal, "however provocatively she might array herself, was romantic rather than sexual, and that is the reason women liked her. Her spirit leaped first and her body, in total exquisite accord, leaped after. She yearned not for pleasure in bed but for love in eternity."<p> Appreciations with this much sensitivity and vigor are as hard to find as a critic who can imaginatively process a lifetime of movie-watching experiences. Moreover, Haskell discusses the larger social significance of the male cinema and male criticism she often finds so infantile. At one point, despairing over critics who either ignore actresses or transform them into love objects, Haskell bemoans the critics' immaturity as "one of the more common and less endearing manifestations of the eternal adolescence that hangs on the American male--who, by the time he is mature enough to appreciate a woman, is almost ready to retire from the arena. There are a few good years in which he can both appreciate and operate, but not enough (particularly with the current defections from heterosexuality) to satisfy the female population, which may be why more and more women are turning to each other, or to themselves." This fine book, as loving and funny as it is angry, is a must for movie fans as well as anyone interested in gender issues. <i>--Raphael Shargel</i></p>&#39;From Reverence to Rape is an incisive, exceedingly thoughtful look at the distorted lens through which Hollywood has historically viewed women.

In this groundbreaking book, Kershaw and Wade present Brain Change Therapy (BCT), a therapeutic protocol in which clients learn to manage their emotions and behaviors, and thus reduce stress and control emotional reactivity.<br><br> Drawing from the latest neuroscientific research as well as integrative principles from hypnosis, biofeedback, and cognitive therapy, BCT helps clients reach stable neurological and emotional states and thus shift perspectives, attitudes, beliefs, and personal narratives toward the positive. BCT starts with the working assumption that effective therapeutic change must inevitably include a repatterning of neural pathways, and employs &#x201c;self-directed neuroplasticity&#x201d; through the active practicing of focused attention. As an adjunct to these methods, it helps clients create new, empowering life experiences that can serve as the basis for new neural patterns.<br><br> The book begins by laying the foundation for body&#x2013;mind and brain&#x2013;body interventions by exploring the basics of the brain: its anatomy, neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, electrochemical processes, and the rhythms of the brain and body and nature. The authors set forth a detailed protocol for neuroassessment and evaluation of new clients, with particular attention to assessing a client&#x2019;s habitually activated emotional circuits, neural imprints, state flexibility, level of arousal, and any relevant neurobiological conditions.<br><br> The authors go on to outline BCT and its interventions geared toward stress reduction and state change, or the capacity to shift the mind from one emotional state to another and to shift the brain from one neural pattern to another. Protocols for specific presenting problems, such as fear, anxiety, and life-threatening and chronic illnesses are outlined in detail. Because of the breadth of the BCT approach, it is effective in working with individuals who are interested in shifting and conditioning peak performance states of consciousness, and the authors offer protocols for helping their clients reach peak professional performance as well.<br><br> With this book, clinicians will be able to empower their clients to find their way out of a wide range of debilitating mental states.</p><p><p><strong>Carol Kershaw</strong>, EdD, is a licensed psychologist in private practice and codirector of the Milton H.

A&nbsp;luscious, offset-printed, hardcover tome&#x2014;a beautiful and&nbsp;serious addition to the understanding of one of the world&#x2019;s&nbsp;oldest and most popular art forms.<br><br> Electric tattooing as we know it today was invented in&nbsp;New York City at the turn of the 19th century. In the first&nbsp;days of American tattooing, tattoos were primarily worn&nbsp;by sailors and soldiers, outlaws and outsiders. The visual&nbsp;language of what came to be known as &#x201c;traditional tattooing&#x201d;&nbsp;was developed in those early days on the Bowery&nbsp;and catered to the interests of the clientele. Common&nbsp;imagery that soon became canon included sailing ships,&nbsp;women, hearts, roses, daggers, eagles, dragons, wolves,&nbsp;panthers, skulls, crosses, and popular cartoon characters&nbsp;of the era. The first tattooists also figured out that using&nbsp;bold outlines, complimented by solid color and smooth&nbsp;shading, was the proper technique for creating art on a&nbsp;body that would stand the test of time. In the over 100&nbsp;years since then, techniques and styles have evolved, and&nbsp;the customer base has expanded, but the core subject&nbsp;matter and philosophy developed at the dawn of electric&nbsp;tattooing has persisted as perennial favorites through the&nbsp;modern era.<br><br> While most tattoos are inherently ephemeral, transported&nbsp;on skin until the death of the collector, a visual record&nbsp;exists in the form of tattoo flash: the hand-painted sheets&nbsp;of designs posted in tattoo shops for customers to select&nbsp;from. Painted and repainted, stolen, traded, bought and&nbsp;sold, these sheets are passed between artists through one&nbsp;channel or another, often having multiple useful lives in a&nbsp;variety of shops scattered across time and geography. The&nbsp;utility of these original pieces of painted art has made it&nbsp;so that original examples can still be found in use or up for&nbsp;grabs if you know where to look.<br><br> <i>Vintage Tattoo Flash </i>draws from the personal collection&nbsp;of Jonathan Shaw&#x2014;renowned outlaw tattooist and&nbsp;author&#x2014;and represents a selection of over 300 pieces of&nbsp;flash from one of the largest private collections in existence.&nbsp;<i>Vintage Tattoo Flash</i> spans the first roughly 75&nbsp;years of American tattooing from the 1900s Bowery, to&nbsp;50s Texas, through the Pike in the 60s and the development&nbsp;of the first black and grey, single-needle tattooing&nbsp;in LA in the 70s. The book lovingly reproduces entirely&nbsp;unpublished sheets of original flash from the likes of Bob&nbsp;Shaw, Zeke Owen, Tex Rowe, Ted Inman, Ace Harlyn, Ed&nbsp;Smith, Paul Rogers, the Moskowitz brothers, and many,&nbsp;many others relatively known and unknown.</p><p><b>Jonathan Shaw</b>&nbsp;is a world traveling outlaw artist, novelist, blogger, head doctor, anti-folk hero, whorehouse philosopher, legendary tattoo master, and notorious innovator and creator of underground art. Shaw was born in NY to big band legend Artie Shaw and movie star Doris Dowling, and was raised in LA where he learned to tattoo on the legendary Pike boardwalk from old-school California masters. After running with the likes of Jim Morrison, the Manson Family, and Charles Bukowski, he fell prey to heroin addiction and a life of crime. He finally left 1970s Hollywood to travel the world and founded Fun City, the first street tattoo shop in NYC since tattooing was decriminalized in the 1960s."Few have dipped so deeply or functioned so extensively in the cultural underbelly of our world than the notorious artist and adventurer, Jonathan Shaw." -<b>Robert Williams<br></b> <br>"Ranks with the best." -<b>Johnny Depp<br></b> <br>"A living example of human indestructibility that is hard to surpass." -<b>Eugene Hutz (Gogol Bordello)<br></b> <br>"Bold and striking images." -<b>Kat Von D.</b> <br><br>"An American classic, a traditionalist discarding history." -<b>JUXTAPOZ</b> <br><br>"Jonathan Shaw is an acknowledged master craftsman of the present era." -<b>SECONDS</b> <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>"Jonathan Shaw (is) a subversive and criminal inhabitant of the world of human expression." -<b>Jim Jarmusch</b> <br><br>''Jonathan Shaw is a shameless evildoer.'' -<b>Marilyn Manson<br></b> <br>''Jonathan Shaw is the great nightmare anti-hero of the new age.'' -<b>Iggy Pop<br><br></b>"The images in the book, much like the bodies of those whose skin they adorned, read like a history of the cultural concerns of the time&#x2014;from early nautical and military themes of patriotism and seafaring to the popular cartoon characters of a given era and our ever-shifting views on death, birth, and sex." &#x2014;<b><i>Esquire<br></i></b><br>"The pieces in Vintage Tattoo Flash come from the last century, but the highest concentration of work is from the 1900s to the 1960s. They represent much of the familiar iconography of American tattooing: ships, half-dressed women, birds of prey, panthers, daggers, roses, and, yes, hearts emblazoned with mom. What's fascinating to see, by leafing through Shaw's collection, is how the art form has evolved in the last hundred years. By the 1950s and '60s, the Sailor Jerry&#x2013;esque American traditional designs begin to shift into different territory, influenced by other styles of tattooing: a touch of traditional Japanese here, a hint of realism there."&nbsp;&#x2014;<b><i>Men's Journal </i></b> <b><i> <br> </i><br><br>As seen on:<br></b>The Guardian<br>Graphics <br>LA Weekly<br>Ponyboy Magazine</p><h2>Fit &amp; Well: Core Concepts and Labs in Physical Fitness and Wellness</h2><p>Fahey&#39;s Fit and Well is the best-selling Fitness/Wellness textbook series in the higher education market, know for its accuracy, labs, and rigor.

It is a full-spectrum book on intuition covering everything from personal development, e.g. the acquisition of inner silence, development of more joy, and the creation of intuitive time-space mastery, to deeper topics such as the purpose of your life, the soul mate process, collaborative intuition in groups, and your capacity to tap into a Big Picture view of your life. In addition, it has explanatory graphics and pictures, the text is filled with entertaining and informative stories, and every chapter contains challenging exercises which guide your step-by-step acquisition of a more intuitive life. I am very pleased that my copy editor, Tim Meyer, paid close attention to the placement of inspirational quotes which augment or underscore the topic on almost every page. I have so much confidence in my book that I know some chapters all by themselves are worth the $24.95 for a lifetime, hard cover book to serve your personal evolution and enjoyment. For example, I believe the chapters, "Set Time Free" and "Shift Space", make a significant contribution to conversations about and preparations for precognitions, out-of-body experiences, mystical Oneness, and other non-liner, non-local experiences of time-space. The accompanying exercises also challenge you to live in the world differently making it possible to slow time down, co-create with your future, and be more alive in the present. I am also pleased with the Soul Mate Promise which appears in the Chapter entitled, "Mate with Soul." The exercises in this chapter offer all of us pathways for deeper intimacy as we create soul-to-soul connections in a variety of settings. The chapters on business and life on Earth also contain insights about intuition that you will not find any where else in the literature. <p>I am dedicated to my field, have been helping adults access their intuition for almost 30 years, and can modestly state that my book is unique; one which you will never regret buying. Put simply it offers the best of what I have learned about the development of inner wisdom during my long career with the subject. </p><p>It is fitting that the book itself is beautiful because <i>You Already Know What To Do</i> touches the beauty and power of your inner being.

The text also implements the latest national standards and recommendations regarding geometry for the preparation of high school mathematics teachers&#x2014;and encourages students to make connections between their college courses and classes they will later teach. This text's coverage begins with Euclid's <i>Elements</i>, lays out a system of axioms for geometry, and then moves on to neutral geometry, Euclidian and hyperbolic geometries from an axiomatic point of view, and then non-Euclidean geometry. Good proof-writing skills are emphasized, along with a historical development of geometry. The <b>Second Edition</b> streamlines and reorganizes material in order to reach coverage of neutral geometry as early as possible, adds more exercises throughout, and facilitates use of the open-source software Geogebra.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> This text is ideal for an undergraduate course in axiomatic geometry for future high school geometry teachers, or for any student who has not yet encountered upper-level math, such as real analysis or abstract algebra. It assumes calculus and linear algebra as prerequisites.</p><p></p><h2>The Guide to Good Health for Teens &amp; Adults With Down Syndrome</h2><p><b>2010 <i>ForeWord Reviews</i> Book of the Year Silver Award Winner, Health Category</b><br> <b>Chosen as a <i>Library Journal</i> Best Consumer Health Book of 2010</b> <p> The authors of the bestselling <b>Mental Wellness in Adults with Down Syndrome</b> turn their attention to the physical health of teens and adults with Down syndrome. </p><p> Drs. Chicoine and McGuire provide invaluable insight into what health problems are more common in their patients, and how medical issues can present differently in people with Down syndrome. In a clear, empathetic style, they discuss how to promote a healthy lifestyle to prevent problems, and how to recognize health problems early on to ensure appropriate care and the best outcome. <b>THE GUIDE TO GOOD HEALTH</b> is a resource families and caregivers can refer to over and over again, whether it s to find strategies to get a teen or adult to cooperate with treatment, or to consider if a symptom is being misdiagnosed or misunderstood. </p><p> Key topics include: -Characteristics of Down syndrome that can affect health care; -More commonly occurring medical issues; -The connection between mental &amp; physical health; -Dealing with hospitalizations; -Long term health and well being throughout the lifespan; -Advance directives and end of life issues; -Specific medical conditions (ranging from skin and nail problems, eye, nose and throat issues, and cardiac concerns, to thyroid disorder, diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and sleep problems). </p><p> For each condition, the authors discuss symptoms, the diagnostic process, and treatment options. Real-life examples from the authors decades of experience help to illustrate how some medical problems can mistakenly be attributed to characteristics of Down syndrome. As the average person with Down syndrome lives considerably longer than in previous generations, <b>THE GUIDE TO GOOD HEALTH</b> can also help families know what to expect during the aging process.</p></p><p>Brian Chicoine, M.D., is the Medical Director of the Adult Down Syndrome Center of Lutheran General Hospital in suburban Chicago. <p> Dennis McGuire, Ph.D., is the Director of Psychosocial Services for the Adult Down Syndrome Center. </p><p> Together they founded The Center in 1992 and have served more than 4,000 adults with Down syndrome since its inception.</p>*Chicoine and McGuire founded Chicago's Adult Down Syndrome Clinic in 1992 to meet the health needs of adolescent and adult Down Syndrome (DS) people. While care for DS children can be very good, quality appears to drop as they age and move out of pediatric practices. This excellent book provides a wealth of information for DS caregivers, including how to find a physician who will provide a comprehensive medical home. Health problems may be difficult to diagnose and treat because of communication and mental challenges; guidelines for teaching health-promoting behaviors and correctly 'reading' health distress signals are clear and well written. Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of common health conditions impacting DS people are described. Mental and emotional issues that can affect physical health are covered. Sexuality and birth control are discussed, as is abuse prevention. Information on residential option as well as end of life issues is provided. VERDICT This is an extremely informational volume that should have a place in all consumer health libraries serving patrons with DS. --Library Journal (*starred review), August 17, 2010<br><br> [A] must-have for parents and caretakers of adolescents and adults with Down syndrome. In twenty-three exhaustive chapters on everything from thyroid problems to cancer to sleep issues, the authors explain in plain English the common medical problems the Down syndrome population can experience. --Mile High Down Syndrome Association's <i>Down's Update</i>, January/February 2011<br><br>Chicoine and McGuire have more experience caring for the physical and mental health of teens and adults with Down syndrome than anyone. Their experience has produced THE GUIDE TO GOOD HEALTH FOR TEENS &amp; ADULTS WITH DOWN SYNDROME which is filled with thoughtful, practical advice and written in a straight forward style making their recommendations accessible for families and healthcare professionals. They have simplified the complex and interrelated physical and mental health issues found in Down syndrome and produced an incredible guide. - Nancy J.

Her countrywoman, Zinaida Zhemchuzhnaia, expressed a similar need to take note: "I want to write about the way those events were perceived and reflected in the humble and distant corner of Russia that was the Cossack town of Korenovskaia." What these women witnessed and experienced, and what they were moved to describe, is part of the extraordinary portrait of life in revolutionary Russia presented in this book. A collection of life stories of Russian women in the first half of the twentieth century, In the Shadow of Revolution brings together the testimony of Soviet citizens and �migr�s, intellectuals of aristocratic birth and Soviet milkmaids, housewives and engineers, Bolshevik activists and dedicated opponents of the Soviet regime. In literary memoirs, oral interviews, personal dossiers, public speeches, and letters to the editor, these women document their diverse experience of the upheavals that reshaped Russia in the first half of this century.</p><br><p> As is characteristic of twentieth-century Russian women's autobiographies, these life stories take their structure not so much from private events like childbirth or marriage as from great public events. Accordingly the collection is structured around the events these women see as touchstones: the Revolution of 1917 and the Civil War of 1918-20; the switch to the New Economic Policy in the 1920s and collectivization; and the Stalinist society of the 1930s, including the Great Terror. Edited by two preeminent historians of Russia and the Soviet Union, the volume includes introductions that investigate the social historical context of these women's lives as well as the structure of their autobiographical narratives.</p></p><p><p>"A pleasure to read and hugely absorbing. The variations in the memoirs, the clear evidence that many were written under extremely circumscribed conditions, gives one of the best introductions possible to Soviet history. Hearing the voices of individuals writing in different eras gives the reader a sense not only of the experiences women lived through (many of them terribly tragic) but also of the language they used and the terms in which they thought about their own life experiences."<b>--Elizabeth A.

And for a millennium and a half, the philosophers and theologians of Europe have scorned the marketplace. The bourgeois life, capitalism, Mencken&#x2019;s &#x201c;booboisie&#x201d; and David Brooks&#x2019;s &#x201c;bobos&#x201d;&#x2014;all have been, and still are, framed as being responsible for everything from financial to moral poverty, world wars, and spiritual desuetude. Countering these centuries of assumptions and unexamined thinking is Deirdre McCloskey&#x2019;s <i>The Bourgeois Virtues</i>, a magnum opus that offers a radical view: capitalism is good for us.<br><br>McCloskey&#x2019;s sweeping, charming, and even humorous survey of ethical thought and economic realities&#x2014;from Plato to Barbara Ehrenreich&#x2014;overturns every assumption we have about being bourgeois. Can you be virtuous and bourgeois? Do markets improve ethics? Has capitalism made us better as well as richer? Yes, yes, and yes, argues McCloskey, who takes on centuries of capitalism&#x2019;s critics with her erudition and sheer scope of knowledge. Applying a new tradition of &#x201c;virtue ethics&#x201d; to our lives in modern economies, she affirms American capitalism without ignoring its faults and celebrates the bourgeois lives we actually live, without supposing that they must be lives without ethical foundations. <br><br><i>High Noon</i>, Kant, Bill Murray, the modern novel, van Gogh, and of course economics and the economy all come into play in a book that can only be described as a monumental project and a life&#x2019;s work. <i>The Bourgeois Virtues </i>is nothing less than a dazzling reinterpretation of Western intellectual history, a dead-serious reply to the critics of capitalism&#x2014;and a surprising page-turner.</p><p><b>Deirdre N. McCloskey</b> is distinguished professor of economics, history, English, and communication at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Among her many books are <i>Crossing: A Memoir </i>and <i>If You&#x2019;re So Smart: The Narrative of Economic Expertise</i>, both published by the University of Chicago Press."Deirdre McCloskey's unfashionable, contrarian, and compelling manifesto in favor of what she calls the bourgeois virtues starts with an uncompromising 'apology' for how private property, free labor, free trade, and prudent calculation are the font of most ethical good in modern society, not a moral threat to it. . . . Ms McCloskey is spectacularly well read. She can pull an apposite quotation not only from her heroes, such as Adam Smith and Thomas Aquinas, but also from Thucydides and Machiavelli, or from the anthropologist Ruth Benedict and the contemporary philosopher Alistair MacIntyre, or (for that matter) from the movies 'Groundhog Day' and 'Shane.' What is more, she writes with wonderful ease. Her style is conversational and lively, sometimes even cheeky, so that even the toughest concepts seem palatable." (Matt Ridley <i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;An impressive collection of intellectual riches.&#x201d;</p> (Alan Ryan <i>New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Bourgeois Virtues</i> is the most comprehensive attempt yet published to show that Sunday and Monday virtues are compatible and complementary. Deirdre McCloskey's grasp of history, philosophy, the social sciences and non-Christian religions makes the treatment of the classical virtues rich and deep."&#x2014;James Halteman, <i>Christian Century</i> (James Halteman <i>Christian Century</i>)<br><br>"A significant contribution to the study of the moral basis of economic life and thought. McCloskey has woven many sources and a number of traditions together to provide the beginnings of an argument and discussion of the role of virtues in economic life. Her approach intersects with, but also challenges, ongoing steams of research in the areas of behavioral economics and social, cultural, and institutional economics, and her vision is original." (Jonathan S. Feinstein <i>Journal of Economic Literature</i>)<br><br>"This book is unfair in many ways. For all the seriousness of the content, it is written in such a beguiling manner that the reader is seduced into reading for sheer enjoyment rather than dutifully putting together wisdom and enlightenment." (Paul B. Trescott <i>Magill's Literary Annual</i>)<br><br>"This is an admirable start to a bold project. Readers will find the extensive citations from literature, art, and history entertaining and informative, and the scope of the study should provide food for thought on a wide range of topics.. Most importantly . . . it illuminates the question at the heart of current debates over the marklet system and how it affects people." (John D.

The authors emphasize multi-factor explanations of disorders as well as developmental frameworks and developmental pathways--presenting disorders and sets of disorders in the order in which they typically appear in a child&#39;s life. They also focus on the child-in-context (calling attention to the multiple settings in which the child is embedded) and emphasize the importance of taking a broad view that considers the whole child and his or her patterns of interest, abilities, and strengths, rather than a narrow view of a disorder or developmental delay. As a result of this holistic approach, which reflects the most up-to-date understanding of child and adolescent psychopathology, readers learn to think about disorders in the same way that caring adults think about disorders they encounter every day--in terms of an individual child who is coping with distress and dysfunction.

Using the newest research on human attachment and brain development, Terri Apter, an internationally acclaimed psychologist and writer, unlocks the mysteries of this complicated bond. She showcases the five different types of difficult mother&#x2015;the angry mother, the controlling mother, the narcissistic mother, the envious mother, and the emotionally neglectful mother&#x2015;and explains the patterns of behavior seen in each type. Apter also explores the dilemma at the heart of a difficult relationship: why a mother has such a powerful impact on us and why we continue to care about her responses long after we have outgrown our dependence. She then shows how we can conduct an &#x201c;emotional audit&#x201d; on ourselves to overcome the power of the complex feelings a difficult mother inflicts. In the end this book celebrates the great resilience of sons and daughters of difficult mothers as well as acknowledging their special challenges.</p><p>Terri Apter is a writer, psychologist, and retired Fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge.

Engaging with a phenomenally wide range of ideas, issues, and thinkers from the Enlightenment to today, Eagleton discusses the state of religion before and after 9/11, the ironies surrounding Western capitalism&#x2019;s part in spawning not only secularism but also fundamentalism, and the unsatisfactory surrogates for the Almighty invented in the post-Enlightenment era.<br> &nbsp;<br> The author reflects on the unique capacities of religion, the possibilities of culture and art as modern paths to salvation, the so-called war on terror&#x2019;s impact on atheism, and a host of other topics of concern to those who envision a future in which just and compassionate communities thrive.

Far from limited to athletes and actors, superstitious beliefs are common among people of all occupations and every educational and income level. Here, Stuart Vyse investigates our proclivity towards these irrational beliefs. Superstitions, he writes, are the natural result of several well-understood psychological processes, including our human sensitivity to coincidence, a penchant for developing rituals to fill time (to battle nerves, impatience, or both), our efforts to cope with uncertainty, the need for control, and more. Vyse examines current behavioral research to demonstrate how complex and paradoxical human behavior can be understood through scientific investigation, while he addresses the personality features associated with superstition and the roles of superstitious beliefs in actions. Although superstition is a normal part of human culture, Vyse argues that we must provide alternative methods of coping with life's uncertainties by teaching decision analysis, promoting science education, and challenging ourselves to critically evaluate the sources of our beliefs.<br></p><p>Wade Boggs is one of the best hitters baseball has ever known; at the plate he's a master technician.

Starting with the superstitions of ballplayers, Stuart Vyse, a psychology professor at Connecticut College, embarks on a fascinating exploration of superstitious thoughts in <i>Believing In Magic</i>.

By the 1790s, more than thirty had done so. Yet, in the two intervening centuries, most of that verse has disappeared from view--now either ignored or forgotten.<br> This delightful anthology takes us back to Augustan England, introducing over one hundred of these lost poets from Lady Mary Chudleigh and Octavia Walsh to Mary Locke and Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire. Their poetry speaks with vigor and immediacy, in a range of moods from the resentful and melancholic to the humorous and exuberant, as they unveil their individual worlds to us. They came from all levels of society--including washerwomen and duchesses--and from both the town and country. The volume reveals that as eighteenth-century women poets gained confidence, their writing eventually spanned a variety of poetic forms and encompassed both public and private topics. <em>Eighteenth-Century Women Poets</em> offers a compelling reassessment of a neglected aspect of eighteenth-century literature.<br></p><p><br><strong>Roger Lonsdale</strong>, a Fellow and Tutor of Balliol College, Oxford, is the editor of <em>The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth-Century Verse</em>.<br>`not just a marvellous piece of scholarship but as richly entertaining and original a book as I have come across for some time. Out of the dust of the Bodleian Dr Lonsdale has resurrected more than a hundred witty women and set them glistening and pulsing with life and spirits before us; and<br>through their fresh and often subversive eyes, the Augustan age seems much closer than it did ... Feminists will want to thank Lonsdale for restoring Mrs Browning's poetic ancestors, but not feminists alone.

His many books include <i>The Power and the Glory</i>, <i>The Third Man</i>, <i>Our Man in Havana</i>, <i>The Comedians</i> and <i>Travels with My Aunt</i>. He is the subject of an acclaimed three-volume biography by Norman Sherry.Graham Greene's last published novel offers clues to the autobiographical motifs running through Greene's long career: the horrors of prep school, the loneliness of childhood, the mysteries of basement rooms, the difficulty of finding love. Jim Baxter is removed from his school by a mysterious figure called the Captain; years later, they meet again in Noriega's Panama amid political turmoil. Kenneth Branagh reads the book effectively; his low-key characterizations are lucid and believable. The sure pacing and clarity of Branagh's delivery make one wish his talents had been applied to a richer Greene novel, rather than this slim finale to a great career. G.H.

It argues that diversity is a reflection of humans&#39; ability to adapt to environments, organize activities, and regulate breeding behavior. This book reviews the history, behavior, and demography of contemporary populations and the distribution of major distinctions of body form, size, and skin color. The book traces the concept of race and analyzes faulty perceptions of human differences and issues of racism on assumed inherited inequality. It incorporates the latest DNA technology into a discussion of genetic markers including their adaptive significance. It also reviews ongoing evolution. The fourth edition of Human Variation: Races, Types, and Ethnic Groups has been revised to include a reorganization of chapters to unite discussions of inherited traits with explanations of their adaptive significance. The book also includes the latest data and a glossary of the latest terminology. A valuable reference book for any reader interested in the biological diversity of the human species.</p><h2>The Cherry Tree</h2><p>After a war destroys their Japanese village and kills their father, Taichi and Yumiko find hope by nursing a cherry tree through a harsh winter and seeing it blossom into new life.</p><p>Hope springs eternal--even in the dark aftermath of war--as seen in this picture book. After bombs have destroyed their Japanese village and killed their father, Taichi and Yumiko's broken-hearted mother must go to town and earn money shining shoes. Left to play outdoors each day, the children encounter an old man tending a brittle, dead-looking cherry tree. They help care for the tree through the harsh winter, and despite the old man's doubts, their vigilance pays off--the resulting pink blossoms rekindle the spirits of the entire village. As in The Snow Country Prince , their previous collaboration, Ikeda and Wildsmith present a tender story about the rewards of kindness. Ikeda's quiet text is infused with the innocence and curiosity embodied in his child protagonists; his message is fundamental without being didactic. Wildsmith's airy watercolors depict a Japanese countryside in the process of rebirth--indigenous animals, plants and native people in brilliant garb all come to life. A spread showing the cherry tree in its full flowering glory is breathtaking. Ages 4-8. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.K Up-- A British translation of a Japanese story set in a village that has been devasted by war. Brother and sister Taichi and Yumiko watch their mother leave for work every day; their once easy life is now difficult and dreary. The children find a sickly tree and notice an old man wrapping straw around its trunk to protect it from the cold. The tree has not blossomed since the bombing, but the old man believes that with a little kindness and patience it will flower again. The children decide to help. One spring morning, the tree is in bloom. People come from all around to see it, and ``in time, the village also came back to life.'' Unlike Seuss's Butter Battle Book (Random, 1984) or others comparable to it, Ikeda concentrates solely on the aftereffects of war and the importance of keeping hope alive. The vivid double-page spreads done in watercolor and ink are unmistakeably Wildsmith. As always, his illustrations, rich and bold in color, help to embellish this heartwarming tale. --Rachel Fox, Port Washington Public Library, NY<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Winston Churchill (Famous Lives) (3.3 Young Reading Series Three (Purple))</h2><p>Winston Churchill</p><p></p><h2>Quick Service</h2><p>Spring brings four more antic novels by P.

SS-Panzerkorps and the Battles for Warsaw, July&#x2013;November 1944</h2><p>During World War Two, the armed or Waffen-SS branch of the Third Reich&#x2019;s dreaded security service expanded from two divisions in 1940 to 38 divisions by the end of the war, eventually growing to a force of over 900,000 men until Germany&#x2019;s defeat in May 1945. Not satisfied with allowing his nascent force to be commanded in combat by army headquarters of the Wehrmacht, Heinrich Himmler, chief of the SS, began to create his own SS corps and army headquarters beginning with the SS-Panzerkorps in July 1942. As the number of Waffen-SS divisions increased, so did the number of corps headquarters, with 18 corps and two armies being planned or activated by the war&#x2019;s end.<br><br>The histories of the first three SS corps are well known &#x2013; the actions of I, II, and III (Germanic) SS-Panzerkorps and their subordinate divisions, including the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, Das Reich, Hitlerjugend, Hohenstaufen, Frundsberg and Nordland divisions, have been thoroughly documented and publicized. Overlooked in this pantheon is another SS corps that never fought in the west or in Berlin but one that participated in many of the key battles fought on the Eastern Front during the last year of the war &#x2013; the IV SS-Panzerkorps. Activated during the initial stages of the defense of Warsaw in late July 1944, the corps, consisting of both the 3. and 5. SS-Panzer Divisions (Totenkopf and Wiking, respectively) was born in battle and spent the last ten months of the war in combat, figuring prominently in the battles of Warsaw, the attempted Relief of Budapest, Operation Spring Awakening, the defense of Vienna, and the withdrawal into Austria where it finally surrendered to U.S. forces in May 1945.<br><br>Herbert Otto Gille&#x2019;s IV SS-Panzerkorps was renowned for its tenacity, high morale and, above all, its lethality, whether conducting a hard-hitting counterattack or a stubborn defense in situations where its divisions were hopelessly outnumbered. Often embroiled in heated disputes with its immediate Wehrmacht higher headquarters over his seemingly cavalier conduct of operations, Gille&#x2019;s corps remained to the bitter end one of the Third Reich&#x2019;s most reliable and formidable field formations.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Contents<br><br>Forward<br>Illustrations<br>Maps<br>I: Early Formation 1943 &#x2013; 44<br>II.

It encompasses the 98 years of Chagall&#x2019;s life (1887-1985) in Russia, France, the US, as well as Germany and Israel, his deep roots in folk culture, his personal relationships and loves, his involvement with the art of the Russian Revolution, with Surrealism, Communism, Zionism, Yiddish literature and the state of Israel. The book exposes the complex relationships between Chagall&#x2019;s three cultural identities: Jewish-Russian-French. Indeed, it is a biography of the turbulent times of the twentieth century and the transformations of a Jew in it, his meteoric rise from the &#x201c;ghetto&#x201d; of the Russian Pale of Settlement to the centers of modern culture. The book reveals Chagall&#x2019;s endless curiosity, his forays in many directions beyond painting and drawing: public art, theater and ballet, stained glass windows in churches and synagogues, lithographs, etchings, and illustrations of literature and the Bible. We observe the intricate relations between Chagall&#x2019;s life and consciousness and the impact of his life on the iconography of his art. Thus, the book provides an indispensable key to the understanding of Chagall&#x2019;s often enigmatic art. Indeed, it is a contribution to the understanding of some of the central problems of Modern art, such as the question of originality, the interaction between the formal discoveries of the avant-garde and cultural or multi-cultural representation, and the relations between an artist&#x2019;s art and his personal biography. Renowned Israeli-American scholar Benjamin Harshav presents the first comprehensive investigation of Marc Chagall&#x2019;s life and consciousness after the classic 1961 biography by Chagall&#x2019;s son-in-law Franz Meyer. Harshav&#x2019;s narrative includes hundreds of private letters and documents written by Chagall and his contemporaries in Russian, Yiddish, French, English and other languages, translated by Benjamin and Barbara Harshav into English, and placed in their personal and historical context.</p><p>&#x201c;Yale University&#x2019;s Professor Benjamin Harshav is the preeminent Jewish culture critic today.

It was a fairly simple&#x2014;albeit<br>large&#x2014;vehicle. I could even do some of the work on it myself. There was a lot<br>of room under the hood and few electronics. The only engine sensors were a<br>temperature gauge and an oil-pressure gauge.<br><br>Things are very different with my &#x2019;99 Volvo. There&#x2019;s no extra room under<br>the hood&#x2014;and there are lots of electronics.

These sensors can identify<br>abnormalities long before the vehicle&#x2019;s performance is affected. They are<br>making early diagnoses.<br><br>Maybe your check-engine lights have been very useful. Maybe one of<br>them led you to do something important (like add oil) that prevented a much<br>bigger problem later on.<br><br>Or maybe you have had the opposite experience.<br><br>Check-engine lights can also create problems. Sometimes they are false<br>alarms (whenever I drive over a big bump, one goes off warning me that<br>something&#x2019;s wrong with my coolant system). Often the lights are in response<br>to a real abnormality, but not one that is especially important (my favorite is<br>the sensor that lights up when it recognizes that another sensor is not sensing).<br>Recently, my mechanic confided to me that many of the lights should<br>probably be ignored.<br><br>Maybe you have decided to ignore these sensors yourself. Or maybe<br>you&#x2019;ve taken your car in for service and the mechanic has simply reset them<br>and told you to wait and see if they come on again.<br><br>Or maybe you have had the unfortunate experience of paying for an<br>unnecessary repair, or a series of unnecessary repairs. And maybe you have<br>been one of the unfortunate few whose cars were worse off for the efforts.<br><br>If so, you already have some feel for the problem of overdiagnosis.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t know what the net effect of all these lights has been. Maybe they<br>have done more good than harm. Maybe they have done more harm than<br>good. But I do know there&#x2019;s little doubt about their effect on the automotive<br>repair business: they have led to a lot of extra visits to the shop.<br><br>And I know that if we doctors look at you hard enough, chances are we&#x2019;ll<br>find out that one of your check-engine lights is on.<br><i><b><br>A routine checkup</b></i><br><br>I probably have a few check-engine lights on myself.

But with intensive early intervention and Applied Behavior Analysis techniques, children can be taught how to communicate successfully, even before they acquire the ability to use speech. A Picture&#39;s Worth examines the value of non-verbal communication strategies for children with autism, and presents the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) in detail. PECS is a communication system that allows a child to use a picture (or series of pictures) to express his needs and desires without a prompt or cue from another person. Authors Bondy and Frost co-developed PECS during many years of experience working with children with autism, and now share their expertise in this easy-to-understand guide for parents. After a thorough review of verbal communication development, A Picture&#39;s Worth explains how autism affects the acquisition and progression of those skills. Without the ability to express themselves, children with autism experience a high level of frustration, which is the root cause of many undesirable behaviors. The book explores the relationship between behavior and communication, teaching parents how to recognize patterns in their own child&#39;s behavior and when to begin a visual communication program such as PECS. The authors recommend that parents teach PECS in a succession of six phases. Each phase builds on the previous one, until a child is capable of constructing sentences with pictures to make requests and comments about his surroundings. The book provides many real-life case studies, along with a complete series of lessons, from beginner to more advanced PECS techniques. There is no minimum age or cognitive level required for a child to begin learning PECS. While PECS is frequently used with children who are non-verbal, it has been used effectively with kids who speak, but do not initiate c</p><p>A Picture&#39;s Worth, written by the developers of the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), is now available in a second edition. This user-friendly guide introduces PECS, a simple and empowering communication tool, in which a child can use a picture card (photo or line drawing) to express his or her desires without prompting from another person. As a person&#39;s PECS usage progresses, there are guidelines for teaching how to express more complex desires, comments and questions. A Picture&#39;s Worth examines verbal communication development and how autism affects these skills and can lead to problem behaviors. By providing the communication options described in this book?PECS and the other augmentative and alternative communication strategies (AAC)?parents and professional can significantly reduce their child or student&#39;s frustration and enhance learning.Andy Bondy, Ph.D., has over 30 years experience working with children and adults with autism and developmental disabilities.

Guided by the questions <em>How did the situation get this way?</em> and <em>How does it stay this way?,</em> Schwalbe tracks inequality from its roots to its regulation. In the final chapter, "Escaping the Inequality Trap," he also shows how inequality can be overcome. Throughout, Schwalbe's engaging writing style draws students into the material, providing instructors with a solid foundation for discussing this challenging and provocative subject. <br><br> With its lively combination of incisive analysis and compelling fictional narratives, <em>Rigging the Game</em> is an innovative teaching tool--not only for courses on stratification, but also for social problems courses, introductory sociology courses, and any course that takes a close look at how the inequalities of race, class, and gender are perpetuated.</p><p><br><strong>Michael Schwalbe</strong> is a professor of sociology at North Carolina State University.

Throughout the text he provides concrete examples to illustrate concepts and theories. His analysis of how social inequality is perpetuated will make social stratification understandable and help students visualize how oppression is part of everyday life."--Carolyn E.

This is a real teaching text."--Martin Eisenberg, <em>Queens College</em><p></p><br>"I especially love the last chapter, with Schwalbe's hopeful conclusions and community-oriented approach. This is precisely what students need to learn to co-create the alternative institutions necessary to propel us forward into the emerging global multicultural millennium.

By the end of the century, however, the most profitable corporations and banks in the country lent money to millions of American debtors. How did this happen? The first book to follow the history of personal debt in modern America, <i>Debtor Nation</i> traces the evolution of debt over the course of the twentieth century, following its transformation from fringe to mainstream--thanks to federal policy, financial innovation, and retail competition.</p><br><p> How did banks begin making personal loans to consumers during the Great Depression? Why did the government invent mortgage-backed securities? Why was all consumer credit, not just mortgages, tax deductible until 1986? Who invented the credit card? Examining the intersection of government and business in everyday life, Louis Hyman takes the reader behind the scenes of the institutions that made modern lending possible: the halls of Congress, the boardrooms of multinationals, and the back rooms of loan sharks. America's newfound indebtedness resulted not from a culture in decline, but from changes in the larger structure of American capitalism that were created, in part, by the choices of the powerful--choices that made lending money to facilitate consumption more profitable than lending to invest in expanded production.</p><br><p> From the origins of car financing to the creation of subprime lending, <i>Debtor Nation</i> presents a nuanced history of consumer credit practices in the United States and shows how little loans became big business.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Debtor Nation</i> explains how in recent decades American consumers and households got more and more access to credit at the very time they became less and less able to handle the resulting debts. The recent financial crisis and the anemic recovery from the resulting Great Recession have exposed this Achilles heel of modern finance.

Each object, whether an engraved shell case, cigarette lighter or a pen made from shrapnel, tells a unique and moving story about its maker. For the first time, this book explores in-depth the history and cultural importance behind these ambiguous art forms. Not only do they symbolize human responses to the atrocities of war, but they also act as mediators between soldiers and civilians, individuals and industrial society, and, most importantly, between the living and the dead. Trench art resonates most obviously with the terror of endless bombardment, night raids, gas attacks and the bestial nature of trench life. It grew in popularity between 1919 and 1939 when the bereaved embarked on battlefield pilgrimages and returned with objects intended to keep alive the memory of loved ones. The term trench art is, however, misleading, as it does not simply refer to materials found in the trenches. It describes a diverse range of objects that have in some way emerged from the experience of war all over the world. Many distinctive objects, for example, were made during conflicts in Bosnia, Vietnam, Northern Ireland and Korea. Surprisingly, trench art predates World War I and it can be made in a number of earlier wars such as the Crimean War, the American Civil War, and the Boer War. Saunders looks at the broader issues of what is meant by trench art, what it was before the trenches and how it fits in with other art movements, as well as the specific materials used in making it. He suggests that it can be seen as a bridge between the nineteenth century certainties and the fragmented industrialized values and ideals of the modern world. This long overdue study offers an original and informative look at one of the most arresting forms of art. Spanning from 1800 to the present day, its analysis of art, human experience, and warfare will pave the way for new research</p><p>Nicholas J. Saunders is Lecturer in Material Culture at University College London, and a Senior Research Fellow at the British Academy.<p>&#x201c;Through his most thorough research, the author has almost single-handedly focused the attention of many collectors and curators to the importance of trench art in just the last few years.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>James Brazier, Stand To!

(The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>What parents need to know about the causes and treatment of children's late talking: how to avoid misdiagnoses, navigate the educational system, and more.</b></p><p>When children are late in hitting developmental milestones, parents worry. And no delay causes more parental anxiety than late talking, which is associated in many parents' minds with such serious conditions as autism and severe intellectual disability. In fact, as children's speech expert Stephen Camarata points out in this enlightening book, children are late in beginning to talk for a wide variety of reasons. For some children, late talking may be a symptom of other, more serious, problems; for many others, however, it may simply be a stage with no long-term complications.</p><p>Camarata describes in accessible language what science knows about the characteristics and causes of late talking. He explains that late talking is only one of a constellation of autism symptoms. Although all autistic children are late talkers, not all late-talking children are autistic. </p><p>Camarata draws on more than twenty-five years of professional experience diagnosing and treating late talkers&#x2015;and on his personal experience of being a late talker himself and having a late-talking son. He provides information that will help parents navigate the maze of doctors, speech therapists, early childhood services, and special education; and he describes the effect that late talking may have on children's post-talking learning styles.</p></p><p>Stephen M. Camarata is Professor in the Department of Hearing and Speech Sciences at Vanderbilt School of Medicine.<p>Among the many anguishes of parenthood is having a child who remains silent long past the age at which his or her age-mates are talking a blue streak. Their deep distress makes them easy prey for hucksters and quacks who are all too happy to multiply their anxiety with dire diagnoses and to sell them on expensive but worthless remedies. In <i>Late-Talking Children</i>, the world's expert on the syndrome offers good sense, humane advice, and the latest science to such parents&#x2015;while reminding his fellow scientists that it raises fascinating questions for our understanding of language, genetics, development, and the organization of the human brain.</p>&#x2015;<b>Steven Pinker</b>, Johnstone Professor of Psychology, Harvard University, and author of <i>The Language Instinct</i> and <i>How the Mind Works</i><br><br><p>Professor Stephen Camarata's new book will be a revelation and a treasure to anxious and puzzled parents of late-talking children. It should also be read by professionals who treat&#x2015;and sometimes mistreat&#x2015;late-talking children, as well as by those who set educational and medical policies.</p>&#x2015;<b>Thomas Sowell</b>, Hoover Institution, Stanford University<br><br><p>I met Dr. Camarata when I was physician-in-chief at Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA. I learned so much from him about children who are late to talk that I encouraged him to write a book for parents. I am glad he did this because his book taught me a lot more. While written for parents, professionals also will learn from his book.</p>&#x2015;<b>Ed McCabe</b>, MD, PhD, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, March of Dimes Foundation<br><br><p>As parents with developmental concerns about our children, we often are told we are the best experts on our own child.

In Jamaica, Hispaniola, Dutch Surinam and elsewhere, massive uprisings threatened European rule. But not in British North America. Between the founding of Jamestown in 1607 and the start of the American Revolution in 1775, the colonies experienced only one notable revolt, on South Carolina's Stono River in 1739, and it lasted a single day. Yet, writes Peter Charles Hoffer, as brief as this event was, historians have misunderstood it--and have thus overlooked its deeper significance.<br><br>In <em>Cry Liberty</em>, Hoffer provides a deeply researched and finely nuanced narrative of the Stono River conflict, offering uncomfortable insights into American slavery. In particular, he draws on new sources to reexamine this one dramatic day. According to conventional wisdom, recently imported African slaves-warriors in spirit and training-learned of an impending war between England and Spain. Seeking freedom from Spanish authorities, the argument runs, they launched a well-planned uprising in order to escape to Florida. But Hoffer has mined legislative and legal records, land surveys, and first-hand accounts to identify precisely where the fighting began, trace the paths taken by rebels and militia, and offer a new explanation of its causes. Far from a noble, well-crafted revolt, he reveals, the slaves were simply breaking into a store to take what they thought was their due, and chance events put them on a path no participant had originally intended. The truth is a far less heroic, but far more of a human tragedy.<br><br>Richly researched, crisply told, and unflinchingly honest, this book uncovers the grim truth about the violent wages of slavery and sheds light on why North America had so few slave rebellions.</p><p><br><strong>Peter Charles Hoffer</strong> is Distinguished Research Professor at the University of Georgia.

He is the author of numerous books, including <em>Past Imperfect</em>; <em>Seven Fires: The Urban Infernos that Reshaped American History</em>; <em>The Brave New World: A History</em> <em>of Early America</em>; and <em>The Supreme Court: An Essential History</em>.<br><br>"This is a smart book--smart because it forces readers to think anew about a topic that is well known to scholars of colonial slavery, the Stono slave rebellion of 1739...Readers will come away with lots to contemplate about the nature of slave resistance in colonial American and about the reading of fragmentary and tantalizing evidence. It is the sort of smart book that students will love." --<em>The Journal of Southern History</em><p></p><br>"Even in what became the Old South, slavery was so complex and varied that historians rarely write thick books with titles like Slavery any more, and with good reason, and this sort of microhistory can tell us a good deal about slave life and resistance in the early south....Although his previous works have focused more on the northern colonies and states, he is clearly a seasoned legal historian, and given the creative borrowing that went on as colonial assemblies crafted laws to protect enslaved labor, he knows ths terrain well."--Doug Egerton, Le Moyne College<p></p><br></p><h2>Synthesis Repertory, Version 9.1 (With CD)</h2><p>Synthesis is the standing repertory of today.Derived from the RADAR software, contains many additions to Kent s Repertory on which it is based.The new version includes modern provings and current many author s ideas and visions.

Soviet power used a variety of tools--from education to propaganda to terror&#x2015;to turn its vision of a Communist world without religion into reality. Yet even with its monopoly on ideology and power, the Soviet Communist Party never succeeded in overcoming religion and creating an atheist society.</p><p><i>A Sacred Space Is Never Empty</i> presents the first history of Soviet atheism from the 1917 revolution to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Drawing on a wealth of archival material and in-depth interviews with those who were on the front lines of Communist ideological campaigns, Victoria Smolkin argues that to understand the Soviet experiment, we must make sense of Soviet atheism. Smolkin shows how atheism was reimagined as an alternative cosmology with its own set of positive beliefs, practices, and spiritual commitments. Through its engagements with religion, the Soviet leadership realized that removing religion from the "sacred spaces" of Soviet life was not enough. Then, in the final years of the Soviet experiment, Mikhail Gorbachev&#x2015;in a stunning and unexpected reversal&#x2015;abandoned atheism and reintroduced religion into Soviet public life.</p><p><i>A Sacred Space Is Never Empty</i> explores the meaning of atheism for religious life, for Communist ideology, and for Soviet politics.</p></p><p><p> "This splendid book skillfully reveals the changing nature of religion in the USSR, the limits of secularization under Communism, and the important place of spirituality in the twentieth century. Smolkin exposes the striking irony of how Soviet authorities found themselves trying to replicate the spiritual and emotional offerings of religion even as they sought to destroy it."<b>--Paul W. Werth, author of <i>The Tsar's Foreign Faiths: Toleration and the Fate of Religious Freedom in Imperial Russia</i></b></p><p> "This is a very important book, highly innovative and superbly researched. Smolkin has written nothing less than a history of the making--and subsequent unmaking--of Soviet atheism. A must-read."<b>--Denis Kozlov, author of <i>The Readers of "Novyi Mir": Coming to Terms with the Stalinist Past</i></b></p><b>Victoria Smolkin</b> is assistant professor of history at Wesleyan University.</p><h2>Welcome to Oz 2.0: A Cinematic Approach to Digital Still Photography with Photoshop (Voices That Matter)</h2><p>Creating memorable photographs is a process that starts before you edit an image in Photoshop, before you capture the image, even before you pick up the camera.

Helen Keller relates her impressions of life's beauty and promise, perceived through the sensations of touch, smell, and vibration, together with the workings of a powerful imagination. <br><i>The World I Live In</i> comprises fifteen essays and a poem, "A Chant of Darkness," all of which originally appeared in <i>The Century Magazine. </i> These brief articles include "The Seeing Hand," "The Hands of Others," "The Power of Touch," "The Finer Vibrations," "Smell, the Fallen Angel" "Inward Visions," and other essays. "Optimism," written while Keller was a college student, offers eloquent observations on acquiring and maintaining a sense of happiness. These essays reflect the author's remarkable achievements, as expressed in her honorary degree from Harvard, the first ever granted to a woman: "From a still, dark world she has brought us light and sound; our lives are richer for her faith and her example."</p><p></p><h2>Original Blessing: Putting Sin in Its Rightful Place</h2><p>Of the world&#39;s three major religions, only Christianity holds to a doctrine of original sin. Ideas are powerful, and they shape who we are and who we become. The fact that many Christians believe there is something in human nature that is, and will always be, contrary to God, is not just a problem but a tragedy. So why do the doctrine&#39;s assumptions of human nature so infiltrate our pulpits, sermons, and theological bookshelves? How is it so misconstrued in times of grief, pastoral care, and personal shame? How did we fall so far from God&#39;s original blessing in the garden to this pervasive belief in humanity&#39;s innate inability to do good? In this book, Danielle Shroyer takes readers through an overview of the historical development of the doctrine, pointing out important missteps and overcalculations, and providing alternative ways to approach often-used Scriptures. Throughout, she brings the primary claims of original sin to their untenable (and unbiblical) conclusions. In Original Blessing, she shows not only how we got this doctrine wrong, but how we can put sin back in its rightful place: in a broader context of redemption and the blessing of humanity&#39;s creation in the image of God.</p><p><p><b>Danielle Shroyer</b> is a sought-after speaker, respected pastor, and a founding member of the emerging church movement. She holds a BA from Baylor University and an MDiv from Princeton Theological Seminary and is the author of <i>Original Blessing: Putting Sin in its Rightful Place</i> and <i>Where Jesus Prayed.</i></p><p>"<i>Original Blessing</i> is a beautiful book with a much needed message for today's church. Readers will learn something about the Bible, about theology, and about church history but most of all, after reading this book they will fall in love with God all over again or maybe for the first time." --Ivy Beckwith, author of <i>Formational Children's Ministry</i> and Faith Formation Minister, United Church of Christ</p><p>"Insightfully theological and compelling pastoral, Danielle Shroyer has offered this witty and thought-provoking book as a blessing to contemporary North American Protestantism. Her articulate argument--peppered with true-to-life illustrations--conveys life and hope from a God-with-us through our brokenness and stubbornness. I highly recommend <i>Original Blessing</i> to anyone seeking to better understand the pervasiveness of sin-talk and the possibility of transformational blessing. Relax and enjoy the gift in your hands. --Tim Hartman, Columbia Theological Seminary<br><br></p><p>"Many of our greatest struggles in life are the result of limited and distorted ways we have learned to see God and ourselves. With the heart of a pastor and the mind of a theologian, Danielle Shroyer invites us to consider the possibility that we are more precious to God and more powerful than we ever imagined. This highly engaging and accessible book challenges commonly held assumptions about sin and human nature with intelligence, clarity, wit, and deep respect for scripture and tradition. You will come away feeling loved and liberated to take new steps to participate in God's unfolding work in the world." --Mark Scandrette, author of <i>Free: Spending Your Time and Money on What Matters Most</i></p><p>"Original sin is one of the most hurtful doctrines within Christianity. Hurtful to ourselves and to others. But what if our identities flow out blessing rather than total depravity? Danielle Shroyer's profound and compelling <i>Original Blessing</i> is a life-giving paradigm shift that draws us out of fear, shame, and guilt and deeper into joy, love, and grace." --Richard Beck, author of <i>Reviving Old Scratch</i><br><br>"The stories we tell ourselves, and one another, carry great power. And, we often have choices in those stories. Danielle Shroyer is telling the story of God that has resounded in the hearts of so many of us even when it did not resound in our sanctuaries, Sunday school rooms, or seminary lecture hallsthat humanity is originally blessed. The alternative stories of the depravity of humanity will certainly linger in our world and even in the deep recesses of some hearts, but Danielle's caring, thoughtful and wise writing will serve to free many from the traps of this misreading the Biblical story. <i>Original Blessing</i> is just that, original and thoughtful and a great blessing to all who read it." --Doug Pagitt, pastor, author, and speaker</p></p><h2>The Guide to Modern Cupping Therapy: Your Step-by-Step Source for Vacuum Therapy</h2><p><p> An ancient alternative technique that has found its right place in the modern world of healing. </p><p> In recent years countless high profile athletes and celebrities have been sporting distinctive circular "cupping" welts on their bodies -- the back and shoulder area being most common.

Lewis&#39;s Mere Christianity: A Biography (Lives of Great Religious Books, 24)</h2><p><p><b>The life and times of C. S. Lewis's modern spiritual classic</b></p><p><i>Mere Christianity</i>, C. S. Lewis's eloquent and winsome defense of the Christian faith, originated as a series of BBC radio talks broadcast during the dark days of World War Two. Here is the story of the extraordinary life and afterlife of this influential and much-beloved book.</p><p>George Marsden describes how Lewis gradually went from being an atheist to a committed Anglican&#x2015;famously converting to Christianity in 1931 after conversing into the night with his friends J. R. R. Tolkien and Hugh Dyson&#x2015;and how Lewis delivered his wartime talks to a traumatized British nation in the midst of an all-out war for survival. Marsden recounts how versions of those talks were collected together in 1952 under the title <i>Mere Christianity</i>, and how the book went on to become one of the most widely read presentations of essential Christianity ever published, particularly among American evangelicals. He examines its role in the conversion experiences of such figures as Charles Colson, who read the book while facing arrest for his role in the Watergate scandal. Marsden explores its relationship with Lewis's Narnia books and other writings, and explains why Lewis's plainspoken case for Christianity continues to have its critics and ardent admirers to this day.</p><p>With uncommon clarity and grace, Marsden provides invaluable new insights into this modern spiritual classic.</p></p><p><p>"A superb study of C. S. Lewis's greatest work. Marsden succeeds both in illuminating the success of <i>Mere Christianity</i> and enriching our own reading of this seminal work."<b>--Alister McGrath, author of <i>C. S. Lewis--A Life</i></b></p><p>"This is a match made in heaven: C. S. Lewis, modernity's most influential Christian voice, interpreted by George Marsden, leading historian of Christian intellectual culture. <i>Mere Christianity</i> has taken on a life of its own, winning converts by its peculiar blend of rhetoric and reason. In unveiling the life of this book and taking the measure of its influence, Marsden has given us an indispensable key to the mind and stature of its author."<b>--Carol Zaleski, coauthor of <i>The Fellowship: The Literary Lives of the Inklings</i></b></p><p>"A significant contribution to Lewis scholarship. No one has surveyed the reception history of <i>Mere Christianity</i> as well as Marsden has done here, and given the enduring popularity and influence of the book, this is a task well worth doing."<b>--Alan Jacobs, author of <i>The Narnian: The Life and Imagination of C. S. Lewis</i></b></p><p>"Though there have been analyses of <i>Mere Christianity</i> before, none has been so comprehensive or serious as this one. Marsden has subjected Lewis's book to an assessment more searching and satisfying than anything so far in print."<b>--Michael Ward, University of Oxford, author of <i>Planet Narnia: The Seven Heavens in the Imagination of C.

Davis retells the story of the West&#x2019;s most notorious range war. Having delved more deeply than previous writers into land and census records, newspapers, and trial transcripts, Davis has produced an all-new interpretation. He looks at the conflict from the perspective of Johnson County residents&#x2014;those whose home territory was invaded and many of whom the invaders targeted for murder&#x2014;and finds that, contrary to the received explanation, these people were not thieves and rustlers but legitimate citizens.<p></p><p>The broad outlines of the conflict are familiar: some of Wyoming&#x2019;s biggest cattlemen, under the guise of eliminating livestock rustling on the open range, hire two-dozen Texas cowboys and, with range detectives and prominent members of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, &#x201c;invade&#x201d; north-central Wyoming to clean out rustlers and other undesirables. While the invaders kill two suspected rustlers, citizens mobilize and eventually turn the tables, surrounding the intruders at a ranch where they intend to capture them by force. An appeal for help convinces President Benjamin Harrison to call out the army from nearby Fort McKinley, and after an all-night ride the soldiers arrive just in time to stave off the invaders&#x2019; annihilation. Though taken prisoner, they later avoid prosecution.</p><p>The cattle barons&#x2019; powers of persuasion in justifying their deeds have colored accounts of the war for more than a century. <i>Wyoming Range War</i> tells a compelling story that redraws the lines between heroes and villains.</p></p><p><p><b>John W.

They cover some of the most pervasive themes of his thought and were written at a time when he had just published his most important&#x2014;and difficult&#x2014;book, <i>Otherwise than Being, or Beyond Essence.</i> Both courses pursue issues related to the question at the heart of Levinas's thought: ethical relation. The Foreword and Afterword place the lectures in the context of his work as a whole, rounding out this unique picture of Levinas the thinker and the teacher. The lectures are essential to a full understanding of Levinas for three reasons. First, he seeks to explain his thought to an audience of students, with a clarity and an intensity altogether different from his written work. Second, the themes of God, death, and time are not only crucial for Levinas, but they lead him to confront their treatment by the main philosphers of the great continental tradition. Thus his discussions of accounts of death by Heidegger, Hegel, and Bloch place Levinas's thought in a broader context. Third, the basic concepts Levinas employs are those of <i>Otherwise than Being</i> rather than the earlier <i>Totality and Infinity</i>: patience, obsession, substitution, witness, traumatism. There is a growing recognition that the ultimate standing of Levinas as a philosopher may well depend on his assessment of those terms. These lectures offer an excellent introduction to them that shows how they contribute to a wide range of traditional philosophical issues.</p><p>&#x201c;Whether or not one agrees with Levinas&#x2019;s unique reading and criticism of Western philosophy and theology, this book must be appreciated for its radical approach to ethics and theology. It deserves careful engagement by all Christian theologians and ehticists whose common intellectual background is the very target of Levinas&#x2019;s criticism.&#x201d;&#x2014;Theological Studies<br>&#x201c;This book serves as a supplement to Levinas&#x2019;s other works. . . .

In these wise, reflective, warmhearted missives, Pissarro, called the father of Impressionism, presents the growth and development of Impressionism and the struggles of its practitioners, as well as pungent and evocative observations on the politics, literature, and daily life of France in the late 19th century. But more than anything, these letters reveal an artist elucidating the inner resources of his craft: Lucien Pissarro, a contemporary of van Gogh, Seurat, and Toulouse-Lautrec, was himself a student of painting, and it was to the young artist above all that his father communicated the unique and illuminating perspectives on art contained in these documents. Brilliantly annotated and introduced by the renowned art historian John Rewald, and featuring a new preface by Barbara Stern Shapiro, Curator for Special Projects at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, this edition of the Letters restores to print one of the most intimate and enjoyable views ever offered of the Impressionist period.</p><p></p><h2>An Imaginative Approach to Teaching</h2><p>In this book, award-winning educator Kieran Egan shows how we can transform the experience of K-12 students and help them become more knowledgeable and more creative in their thinking.

Watts, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong></p> Black Intellectuals offers a centuries-deep analysis of black life, beginning with the arrival of Africans as slaves, when medicine men and conjurers held ancient, powerful wisdom. Author William Banks goes on to discuss prominent figures ranging from black pioneers like Alexander Crummell, Frederick Douglass, and Anna Cooper to intellectuals of the modern age such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Alain Locke, E. Franklin Frazier, Toni Morrison, and Henry Louis Gates, Jr. These and hundreds of other black scholars and artists&#x2015;many of them interviewed for this volume&#x2015;people an enlightened and imaginative landscape, fascinating for both its range and its diversity.</p><p>Banks, a professor of African-American studies at the University of California, Berkeley, has written a scholarly history of black American intellectuals covering some 250 years of progress. The slave generations of African-Americans had precious little opportunity for intellectual pursuits. Initially the community's intellectuals were mostly Christian pastors struggling to reconcile Christianity with the barbarous oppression of their people. Later freed negroes agitating for abolition became more prominent, and the founding in 1827 of <i>Freedom's Journal</i> provided a literary outlet for their work. After reconstruction, a network of black colleges and the proliferation of black newspapers and magazines secured a solid base for an intellectual life that today is thriving more than ever before.William M.

Her own experience lends credibility to the voice of her young narrator, who inhabits a deprived police state in which minorities such as the ethnic Germans suffer persecution beyond the quotidian oppressions of Ceausescu's regime. The title refers to the young woman's observations of the swaggering policemen who wolf down plums from the city trees, even while they're still green; the act serves as a symbol of greed, arbitrary power, and stupidity. Although an element of the story is survival, achieved by clinging to the German culture and language, the novel also confronts the older characters' sympathy with the Nazis. Nevertheless, Muller's fictional heroine finds salvation, as she herself did, in modern Germany.<p>Born in Romania in 1953, Herta M�ller lost her job as a teacher and suffered repeated threats after refusing to cooperate with Ceausescu's Secret Police. She succeeded in emigrating in 1987 and now lives in Berlin. The recipient of the European Literature Prize, she won the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award for <i>The Land of Green Plums</i>. </p></p><h2>The New Physics and Cosmology Dialogues with the Dalai Lama</h2><p>What happens when the Dalai Lama meets with leading physicists and a historian? This book is the carefully edited record of the fascinating discussions at a Mind and Life conference in which five leading physicists and a historian (David Finkelstein, George Greenstein, Piet Hut, Arthur Zajonc, Anton Zeilinger, and Tu Weiming) discussed with the Dalai Lama current thought in theoretical quantum physics, in the context of Buddhist philosophy. A contribution to the science-religion interface, and a useful explanation of our basic understanding of quantum reality, couched at a level that intelligent readers without a deep involvement in science can grasp. In the tradition of other popular books on resonances between modern quantum physics and Zen or Buddhist mystical traditions--notably <em>The Dancing Wu Li Masters</em> and <em>The Tao of Physics</em>, this book gives a clear and useful update of the genuine correspondences between these two rather disparate approaches to understanding the nature of reality.<br></p><p>Arthur Zajonc is at Amherst College.</p><h2>What If? Writing Exercises for Fiction Writers, Second Edition</h2><p>An essential to any writer's library, <i>What If? </i> is comprised entirely of specific exercises intended to help the reader master the art of writing fiction.

Until now, however, there has been no book designed to help students capture the essence of the subject in a brief course of study. Daniel Jacob, a leading researcher and teacher in the field, addresses that problem by presenting the first textbook on atmospheric chemistry for a one-semester course. Based on the approach he developed in his class at Harvard, Jacob introduces students in clear and concise chapters to the fundamentals as well as the latest ideas and findings in the field.</p><br><p> Jacob's aim is to show students how to use basic principles of physics and chemistry to describe a complex system such as the atmosphere. He also seeks to give students an overview of the current state of research and the work that led to this point. Jacob begins with atmospheric structure, design of simple models, atmospheric transport, and the continuity equation, and continues with geochemical cycles, the greenhouse effect, aerosols, stratospheric ozone, the oxidizing power of the atmosphere, smog, and acid rain. Each chapter concludes with a problem set based on recent scientific literature. This is a novel approach to problem-set writing, and one that successfully introduces students to the prevailing issues.</p><br><p> This is a major contribution to a growing area of study and will be welcomed enthusiastically by students and teachers alike.</p></p><p><p>"I can actually imagine a rigorous and challenging undergraduate course making it through this whole text in one semester, which is not the case for its competitors. The problem sets are excellent . . . truly unique."<b>--Hiram Levy, Princeton University</b></p><b>Daniel J.

Tour.</p><p>John Douglas has become the leading expert on criminal personality profiling and the pioneer of modern criminal investigative analysis during his remarkable twenty-five-year career with the FBI. He conducted the first organized study into the methods and motivations of serial criminals and has aided police departments and prosecutors throughout the world. A veteran of the Air Force, he is the author of numerous articles and presentations on criminology and the coauthor of the landmark books <i>Sexual Homicide: Patterns and Motives and Crime Classification Manual.</i> He has been called upon to analyze violent crimes from those of the Unabomber to the Nicole Brown Simpson-Ron Goldman and JonBenet Ramsey murders. John Douglas and Mark Olshaker coauthored <i>Mindhunter: Inside the FBl's Elite Serial Crime Unit; Unabomber: On the Trail of America's Most-Wanted Serial Killer;</i> and <i>Journey into Darkness.</i> He lives in the Washington, D.C., area.A look at rape-and-murder and its perpetrators by one of the men who invented the forensic art of psychological profiling. Douglas (Mindhunter, also with Olshaker, not reviewed, etc.) was the founder and longtime head of the FBI's Investigative Support Unit and over his career saw many cases that went unsolved, including the Green River Killer, a case so frustrating that it nearly killed Douglas himself. Douglas's readers will be familiar with this assortment of famously grisly scenes combined with profiles of the murderers. This book focuses mainly on stalkers and their victims, so Douglas necessarily revisits the scenes of Rebecca Schaffer, Dominique Dunne, and Teresa Saldana. He also gives an overview of rapists/murderers such as Ted Bundy and Gary Heidnik, the City of Brotherly Love's answer to Jeffrey Dahmer. Unfortunately, much of the information here is already so familiar to crime buffs that there isn't much to be gleaned from these sections. Douglas is much better at the beginning, when he discusses a little-known killer who seems to have been the basis for Francis Dolarhyde in Red Dragon (Thomas Harris fans, take note). Douglas's profile of this stalker and killer is illuminating, unlike too much of this book, which is merely titillating. The promise of the subtitle goes unfulfilled--the ``fighting back'' seems limited to victim's families joining support groups, rather than any real advice to those seeking protection from a stalker. In fact, most of these victims had restraining orders against their stalkers, which were of little use in the face of a knife or a gun. Not much more than a collection of truly horrifying stories, which is a shame for both the reader, who justifiably expects more, and for Douglas, who has more to offer.

The typical long-haul trucker works the equivalent of two full-time jobs, often for little more than minimum wage. But it wasn&#x2019;t always this way. Trucking used to be one of the best working-class jobs in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>The Big Rig</i>&nbsp;explains how this massive degradation in the quality of work has occurred, and how companies achieve a compliant and dedicated workforce despite it. Drawing on more than 100 in-depth interviews and years of extensive observation, including six months training and working as a long-haul trucker, Viscelli explains in detail how labor is recruited, trained, and used in the industry. He then shows how inexperienced workers are convinced to lease a truck and to work as independent contractors. He explains how deregulation and collective action by employers transformed trucking&#x2019;s labor markets--once dominated by the largest and most powerful union in US history--into an important example of the costs of contemporary labor markets for workers and the general public.</p><p>&#x201c;Steve Viscelli&#x2019;s <i>The Big Rig</i>&nbsp;is a remarkable book. It combines gripping fine-grained ethnographic accounts of the lived reality of long-haul truck driving in the United States today with a compelling analysis of the macro-structural conditions in which those lives are lived and an historical account of the political economic forces that generated those conditions. These intersecting analyses generate powerful insights into two of the most fundamental questions about the nature of inequality in the United States today: Where do so many bad jobs come from, and why do people put up with them?&#x201d;&#x2014;Erik Olin Wright, author of&nbsp;<i>Envisioning Real Utopias</i><br><br> &#x201c;This riveting account shows how truck drivers&#x2014;seeking the American dream&#x2014;end up being harmed by changes in government policy and business practices.

They are the most versatile of vessels, not only guiding large oceangoing ships safely into harbor, but also conducting rescue operations and navigating vast quantities of oil, cement, and scrap iron through traffic-clogged waters.</p><p>A twenty-year veteran of New York tugboats, George Matteson knows the tides and currents of New York from the Bronx to the Verrazano Narrows. His history of tugboating shows how this inherently risky business pits men and their boats against weather, water, and the scarcely measurable physics of ships and barges of far greater dimension.</p><p>The story of New York&#x2019;s tugs parallels the broader history of New York&#x2019;s industrial development, from the rise of railroads to the decline of the port in the wake of labor disputes and large container ships. It is also a story of remarkable seamen who pass their craft from pilot to apprentice over generations, along with the lore of great waterways that remain unchanged despite the lengthening shadows of skyscrapers and commerce.</p><p>Rich with first-person anecdotes of life on the New York waterways and one hundred and fifty black-and-white illustrations, including rare and sumptuous photographs from the likes of Gordon Parks and Todd Webb, <b>Tugboats of New York</b> will fascinate readers interested in New York history, boating, and maritime history.</p></p><p><p><b>George Matteson</b> has operated tugboats since 1971 and has also worked as the waterfront manager of the South Street Seaport Museum.

Uncle Benn is a world-class genius in botany but a total duffer when it comes to women. Now his erotic escapades and disastrous marriage are about to lead him and Kenneth into a wonderful romp through America&#39;s mind-body dilemma...and into a Bellovian masterpiece of great wisdom and good fun.Put simply, Bellow's new novel is about a distinguished botanist who in middle age is driven by his libido into making a bad marriage. Put thematically, it's about the pursuit of happiness, which all too frequently results only in the acceptance of unhappiness. As in all Bellow's novels since Herzog , philosophical speculation is as important as plot, if not more so. Here Bellow dwells on the cult of sex in contemporary culture, as well as such soul-diminishing demands as the drives for power, wealth, and prestige. For him this entails an ordeal of desire from which the West is suffering as surely as the East suffers from an ordeal of privation. Serious stuff, certainly, but it is Bellow's genius that he can present a provocative novel of ideas as a riotous comedy. Ample proof that Bellow remains one of our most significant writers, the comic sage of American letters.Charles Michaud, Turner Free Lib., Randolph, Mass.<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Duel and Other Stories (Dover Thrift Editions: Short Stories)</h2><p><p>This captivating collection of short stories, selected from works written during Chekhov's prolific period, displays those qualities for which the Russian author and playwright is famous: a natural aptitude for detail, dialogue, humor, and compassion.<br>The six masterfully executed tales, reprinted here in the authoritative Constance Garnett translation, include "The Darling," a poignant piece supporting the claim that life has no meaning without love; "The Kiss," a fanciful confection recounting an officer's brief encounter with an unknown woman; as well as "Anna on the Neck," "The Man in a Case," "The Malefactor," and the title story.<br>As noted by author John Barth, "Chekhov is a superb anatomist of the human heart and an utter master of his literary means. The details of scene and behavior, the emotions registered &#x2014; seldom bravura, typically muted and complex, often as surprising to the characters themselves as to the reader but always right &#x2014; move, astonish, and delight us line after line, story after story."</p><p></p></p><p>Next to Shakespeare, Anton Chekhov (1860&#x2013;1904) is the most popular playwright in the English-speaking world.

The Hewletts are the first anthropologists ever invited by the World Health Organization to join a medical intervention team and assist in efforts to control an Ebola outbreak. Their account addresses political, structural, psychological, and cultural factors, along with conventional intervention protocols as problematic to achieving medical objectives. They find obvious historical and cultural answers to otherwise-puzzling questions about why village people often flee, refuse to cooperate, and sometimes physically attack members of intervention teams. Perhaps surprisingly, readers will discover how some cultural practices of local people are helpful and should be incorporated into control procedures. The authors shed new light on a continuing debate about the motivation for human behavior by showing how local responses to epidemics are rooted both in culture and in human nature. Well-supported recommendations emerge from a comparative analysis of Central African cases and pandemics worldwide to suggest how the United States and other countries might use anthropologists and the insights of anthropologists to mount more effective public health campaigns, with particular attention to avian flu and bioterrorism.</p><p>Barry Hewlett is Professor of Anthropology at Washington State University, Vancouver.

Revealing the wisdom and na vet� of the crusaders&#39; convictions and examining the social bases for their actions, Stewart demonstrates why, despite the ambiguity of its ultimate victory, abolition has left a profound imprint on our national memory.</p><p>The abolitionist movement, writes Stewart in this engaging study, grew out of a number of historical conditions in early American society. Fearful of secularism and materialism, and disdainful of the luxurious life of the upper class, evangelical Christians of varying ethnicity banded together to forge a religious revival called the Great Awakening. In the South these evangelicals, especially the Quakers, confronted slave-holding Anglicans. They steadily worked to convert pro-slavery individuals, and they were often successful. By recruiting escaped slaves to speak out publicly against &#34;the peculiar institution,&#34; the abolitionists galvanized public opinion outside the South, leading to the sectionalism that would later find its ultimate expression in the Civil War. Stewart&#39;s account of the important role that women played in the abolitionist movement is of special interest.Now revised to include important new scholarship, Holy Warriors, James B. Stewart&#39;s eloquent and judicious history of American abolitionism, offers a superb analysis of how the antislavery movement reinforced and transformed the dominant features of pre-Civil War America.</p><h2>Season of the Witch (The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Book 1) (1)</h2><p><b>From the creator of <i>Riverdale</i> comes the <i>Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</i>, a new Netflix eries based on the classic Archie comic series.

She lives in Ireland.CHAPTER ONE: Something Wicked<br><br>We saw the girl at the edge of the woods in early September. Her red sports car was parked under the trees, and she was sitting on the hood of the car wearing a red coat. She looked like a car advertisement that might convince any boy he wanted to buy. <br><br>I&#x2019;m not too bad myself. My aunt Hilda tells me I&#x2019;m cute as a bug&#x2019;s ear, and she genuinely believes bugs are adorable. I would&#x2019;ve mentally congratulated the girl on being airbrushed by Mother Nature and walked on without another glance&#x2015;if my boyfriend hadn&#x2019;t been giving her so many. <br><br>Harvey was walking me home from school. We&#x2019;d been hurrying before he caught sight of the girl, because the wind was rising. One gust of wind curled around us now like an invisible whip. I watched the first leaves fall from the trees in a sudden bright, beautiful flurry of green. They glistened in the air like a rain of emeralds, and I felt a sudden pang. The summer was so close to ending. <br><br>A blanket of thick gray clouds had rolled over the treetops. Greendale was lost to sun and in shadow. Night was coming early. <br><br>I nudged Harvey and tried to keep my voice light. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s hot, but it&#x2019;s freezing out here.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Hey, she&#x2019;s nothing compared to you,&#x201d; said Harvey. &#x201c;Nice car, though.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Sure, you were looking at the car.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I was!&#x201d; Harvey protested. &#x201c;&#x2019;Brina!&#x201d; <br><br>The wind tugged insistently on my jacket as I ran through the new-fallen leaves, as if there were ghosts trying to get my attention. Harvey chased after me, still protesting and laughing. We left the girl in red behind us.<br><br>Harvey, Roz, Susie, and I became besties on our very first day of school, in the way kids do: strangers at first bell and soul mates by lunchtime. People said that someday a boy would stop wanting girls as playmates, and we would lose Harvey as we grew up. We never did.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve loved Harvey my whole life, and I&#x2019;ve had a crush on him almost as long. He was my first kiss, and I&#x2019;ve never wanted another. I remember going on a school expedition through the Greendale woods and finding an abandoned well by a stream. Harvey was so excited by the discovery, he sat on the bank of the stream and sketched a picture of the well at once.<br><br>I sneaked a look at his dark head bowed over the pages of his sketchbook, and wished for him. But I didn&#x2019;t have a coin to throw in the well, and when I tried to throw a pebble in I missed. <br><br>It was winter when Harvey asked me if I wanted to go to the movies. I showed up, and was shocked and thrilled to find it was just the two of us. I was so excited, I still have no idea what happened in that movie. All I remember is the brush of our hands as we both reached for the popcorn. Such a simple, silly thing, but the touch felt electric. He reached out and twined my salty fingers with his own, and I thought, This is how witches burn. <br><br>I remember him leaning in and kissing me at my gate. I closed my eyes, and the kiss was soft, and I was surprised that the whole apple orchard did not transform into blooming red roses.<br><br>From then on, Harvey and I held hands in school, he walked me home every day, and we went on dates. But I never brought up the issue of whether we were official-official, boyfriend-girlfriend. Other people call him my boyfriend, but I never have . . . not yet. I&#x2019;m afraid to lose what we already have.<br><br>My family keep telling me that it can&#x2019;t last. And I&#x2019;m afraid he doesn&#x2019;t feel the same way I do. <br><br>I know Harvey likes me. I know he would never hurt me. But I want his heart to pound at the sight of me, as if someone is demanding entry to his soul. And I wonder if he settled for something safe and familiar. The girl next door, not the forever girl.<br><br>Sometimes I want him to look at me as if I&#x2019;m magic. I am half magic, after all.</p><h2>200 Women: Who Will Change the Way You See the World (Coffee Table book, Inspiring Women&#39;s book, Social book, Graduation book)</h2><p><strong>In this ambitious global project, two hundred women share inspiring stories of success and courage, love and pain, redemption, and generosity.</strong><br><br>This updated, abridged edition includes powerful new interviews and stirring quotes alongside selections from the original book, all answering the same five questions.

No one but his closest friends knew the many different identities he had performed during his life: as Samuel Steward, he had been a popular university professor of English; as Phil Sparrow, an accomplished tattoo artist; as Ward Stames, John McAndrews, and Donald Bishop, a prolific essayist in the first European gay magazines; as Phil Andros, the author of a series of popular pornographic gay novels during the 1960s and 1970s. Steward had also moved in the circles of Gertrude Stein, Thornton Wilder, and Alfred Kinsey, among many other notable figures of the twentieth century. And, as a compulsive record keeper, he had maintained a meticulous card-file index throughout his life that documented his 4,500 sexual encounters with more than 800 men.<br><br> The story of this life would undoubtedly have been a sensation if it had reached publication. But after finishing a 110,000-word draft in 1979, Steward lost interest in the project and subsequently published only a slim volume of selections from his manuscript.<br><br> In <i>The Lost Autobiography of Samuel Steward</i>, Jeremy Mulderig has integrated Steward&#x2019;s truncated published text with the text of the original manuscript to create the first extended version of Steward&#x2019;s autobiography to appear in print&#x2014;the first sensational, fascinating, and ultimately enlightening story of his many lives told in his own words. The product of a rigorous line-by-line comparison of these two sources and a thoughtful editing of their contents, Mulderig&#x2019;s thoroughly annotated text is more complete and coherent than either source alone while also remaining faithful to Steward&#x2019;s style and voice, to his engaging self-deprecation and his droll sense of humor. Compellingly readable and often unexpectedly funny, this newly discovered story of a gay life full of wildly improbable&#x2014;but nonetheless true&#x2014;events is destined to become a landmark queer autobiography from the twentieth century.</p><p><b>Samuel Steward</b> (1909&#x2013;93) was a poet, novelist, and for nearly twenty years a professor at Loyola and DePaul universities in Chicago. In 1956, he left academia and became a tattoo artist in Chicago and later in Oakland, California, and thereafter the author of a popular series of pornographic gay novels. <b>Jeremy Mulderig</b> is professor emeritus in the Department of English at DePaul University in Chicago. He is the editor of <i>Philip Sparrow Tells All: Lost Essays by Samuel Steward</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press.&nbsp;&#x201c;The material is intrinsically interesting; Steward is an engaging prose stylist; and Mulderig is a meticulous and reliable editor who lays out sound editorial principles and accompanies each chapter with judicious notes, glossing the various personae and cultural references with which some contemporary readers may need assistance. Certainly the book will be taught in college classrooms, but it will find an extensive audience outside the university too because it is compulsively readable. A remarkable work.&#x201d; (<i>Tim Dean, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Mulderig has set himself the task of reconstructing Steward&#x2019;s autobiography from a vastly truncated earlier work (<i>Chapters from an Autobiography</i>) and from his unpublished, 110,000-word, shapeless manuscript. . .The result is a reconstructed and expanded version of 85,000 words that has never been published in this form before.

How can he be everywhere at once, and enter and leave locked rooms at will? And what is his connection to the beautiful and talented young soloist Christine?</p><p><i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> is best known perhaps through its many stage and screen adaptations, but Gaston Leroux&#x2019;s original text outdoes them all in its Gothic tension and its haunting horror.</p><p>With an afterword by Peter Harness.</p></p><p>Gaston Leroux was born in Paris in 1868. He grew up on the Normandy coast, where he developed a passion for fishing and sailing. Upon reaching adulthood, he qualified as a lawyer, but, upon his father's death, his received a large inheritance, and left the law to become a writer. He first found fame as an investigative reporter on <i>L'Echo de Paris</i>, and travelled the world in a variety of disguises, reporting on a wide range of topics from volcanic eruptions to palace revolutions. In 1907, he changed career once again, and started work as a novelist, finding critical and commercial success with works such as <i>The Mystery of the Yellow Room</i> (1907) and <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> (1911). Leroux continued to be a prolific writer until his death in 1927 - the result of complications following an operation.<b>1.</b><br><br>Is It the Ghost? It was the evening on which MM. Debienne and Poligny, the managers of the Opera, were giving a last gala performance to mark their retirement. Suddenly the dressing-room of La Sorelli, one of the principal dancers, was invaded by half-a-dozen young ladies of the ballet, who had come up from the stage after &#x201c;dancing&#x201d; Polyeucte. They rushed in amid great confusion, some giving vent to forced and unnatural laughter, others to cries of terror. Sorelli, who wished to be alone for a moment to &#x201c;run through&#x201d; the speech which she was to make to the resigning managers, looked around angrily at the mad and tumultuous crowd. It was little Jammes&#x2014;the girl with the tip-tilted nose, the forget-me-not eyes, the rose-red cheeks and the lily-white neck and shoulders&#x2014;who gave the explanation in a trembling voice:<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the ghost!&#x201d; And she locked the door.<br><br>Sorelli&#x2019;s dressing-room was fitted up with official, commonplace elegance. A pier-glass, a sofa, a dressing-table and a cupboard or two provided the necessary furniture. On the walls hung a few engravings, relics of the mother, who had known the glories of the old Opera in the Rue le Peletier; portraits of Vestris, Gardel, Dupont, Bigottini. But the room seemed a palace to the brats of the corps de ballet, who were lodged in common dressing-rooms where they spent their time singing, quarreling, smacking the dressers and hair-dressers and buying one another glasses of cassis, beer, or even rhum, until the callboy&#x2019;s bell rang.<br><br>Sorelli was very suspicious. She shuddered when she heard little Jammes speak of the ghost, called her a &#x201c;silly little fool&#x201d; and then, as she was the first to believe in ghosts in general, and the Opera ghost in particular, at once asked for details:<br><br>&#x201c;Have you seen him?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As plainly as I see you now!&#x201d; said little Jammes, whose legs were giving way beneath her, and she dropped with a moan into a chair.<br><br>Thereupon little Giry&#x2014;the girl with eyes black as sloes, hair black as ink, a swarthy complexion and a poor little skin stretched over poor little bones&#x2014;little Giry added:<br><br>&#x201c;If that&#x2019;s the ghost, he&#x2019;s very ugly!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes!&#x201d; cried the chorus of ballet-girls.<br><br>And they all began to talk together. The ghost had appeared to them in the shape of a gentleman in dress-clothes, who had suddenly stood before them in the passage, without their knowing where he came from. He seemed to have come straight through the wall.<br><br>&#x201c;Pooh!&#x201d; said one of them, who had more or less kept her head. &#x201c;You see the ghost everywhere!&#x201d;<br><br>And it was true. For several months, there had been nothing discussed at the Opera but this ghost in dress-clothes who stalked about the building, from top to bottom, like a shadow, who spoke to nobody, to whom nobody dared speak and who vanished as soon as he was seen, no one knowing how or where. As became a real ghost, he made no noise in walking. People began by laughing and making fun of this specter dressed like a man of fashion or an undertaker; but the ghost legend soon swelled to enormous proportions among the corps de ballet. All the girls pretended to have met this supernatural being more or less often. And those who laughed the loudest were not the most at ease. When he did not show himself, he betrayed his presence or his passing by accident, comic or serious, for which the general superstition held him responsible. Had any one met with a fall, or suffered a practical joke at the hands of one of the other girls, or lost a powderpuff, it was at once the fault of the ghost, of the Opera ghost.<br><br>After all, who had seen him? You meet so many men in dress-clothes at the Opera who are not ghosts. But this dress-suit had a peculiarity of its own. It covered a skeleton. At least, so the ballet-girls said. And, of course, it had a death&#x2019;s head.<br><br>Was all this serious? The truth is that the idea of the skeleton came from the description of the ghost given by Joseph Buquet, the chief scene-shifter, who had really seen the ghost. He had run up against the ghost on the little staircase, by the footlights, which leads to &#x201c;the cellars.&#x201d; He had seen him for a second&#x2014;for the ghost had fled&#x2014;and to any one who cared to listen to him he said:<br><br>&#x201c;He is extraordinarily thin and his dress-coat hangs on a skeleton frame. His eyes are so deep that you can hardly see the fixed pupils. You just see two big black holes, as in a dead man&#x2019;s skull. His skin, which is stretched across his bones like a drumhead, is not white, but a nasty yellow. His nose is so little worth talking about that you can&#x2019;t see it side-face; and the absence of that nose is a horrible thing to look at. All the hair he has is three or four long dark locks on his forehead and behind his ears.&#x201d;<br><br>This chief scene-shifter was a serious, sober, steady man, very slow at imagining things. His words were received with interest and amazement; and soon there were other people to say that they too had met a man in dress-clothes with a death&#x2019;s head on his shoulders. Sensible men who had wind of the story began by saying that Joseph Buquet had been the victim of a joke played by one of his assistants. And then, one after the other, there came a series of incidents so curious and so inexplicable that the very shrewdest people began to feel uneasy.<br><br>For instance, a fireman is a brave fellow! He fears nothing, least of all fire! Well, the fireman in question, who had gone to make a round of inspection in the cellars and who, it seems, had ventured a little farther than usual, suddenly reappeared on the stage, pale, scared, trembling, with his eyes starting out of his head, and practically fainted in the arms of the proud mother of little Jammes.* And why? Because he had seen coming toward him, at the level of his head, but without a body attached to it, a head of fire! And, as I said, a fireman is not afraid of fire.<br><br>The fireman&#x2019;s name was Pampin.<br><br>The corps de ballet was flung into consternation. At first sight, this fiery head in no way corresponded with Joseph Buquet&#x2019;s description of the ghost. But the young ladies soon persuaded themselves that the ghost had several heads, which he changed about as he pleased. And, of course, they at once imagined that they were in the greatest danger. Once a fireman did not hesitate to faint, leaders and front-row and back-row girls alike had plenty of excuses for the fright that made them quicken their pace when passing some dark corner or ill-lighted corridor. Sorelli herself, on the day after the adventure of the fireman, placed a horse-shoe on the table in front of the stage-door-keeper&#x2019;s box, which every one who entered the Opera otherwise than as a spectator must touch before setting foot on the first tread of the staircase. This horse-shoe was not invented by me&#x2014;any more than any other part of this story, alas!&#x2014;and may still be seen on the table in the passage outside the stage-door-keeper&#x2019;s box, when you enter the Opera through the court known as the Cour de l&#x2019;Administration.<br><br>To return to the evening in question.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the ghost!&#x201d; little Jammes had cried.<br><br>An agonizing silence now reigned in the dressing-room. Nothing was heard but the hard breathing of the girls. At last, Jammes, flinging herself upon the farthest corner of the wall, with every mark of real terror on her face, whispered:<br><br>&#x201c;Listen!&#x201d;<br><br>*I have the anecdote, which is quite authentic, from M. Pedro Gailhard himself, the late manager of the Opera.<br><br>Everybody seemed to hear a rustling outside the door. There was no sound of footsteps. It was like light silk sliding over the panel. Then it stopped.<br><br>Sorelli tried to show more pluck than the others. She went up to the door and, in a quavering voice, asked:<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201d;<br><br>But nobody answered. Then feeling all eyes upon her, watching her last movement, she made an effort to show courage, and said very loudly:<br><br>&#x201c;Is there any one behind the door?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes, yes! Of course there is!&#x201d; cried that little dried plum of a Meg Giry, heroically holding Sorelli back by her gauze skirt. &#x201c;Whatever you do, don&#x2019;t open the door! Oh, Lord, don&#x2019;t open the door!&#x201d;<br><br>But Sorelli, armed with a dagger that never left her, turned the key and drew back the door, while the ballet-girls retreated to the inner dressing-room and Meg Giry sighed:<br><br>&#x201c;Mother! Mother!&#x201d;<br><br>Sorelli looked into the passage bravely. It was empty; a gas-flame, in its glass prison, cast a red and suspicious light into the surrounding darkness, without succeeding in dispelling it. And the dancer slammed the door again, with a deep sigh.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;there is no one there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Still, we saw him!&#x201d; Jammes declared, returning with timid little steps to her place beside Sorelli. &#x201c;He must be somewhere prowling about. I shan&#x2019;t go back to dress. We had better all go down to the foyer together, at once, for the &#x2018;speech,&#x2019; and we will come up again together.&#x201d;</p><h2>Queueing Systems, Vol. 2: Computer Applications</h2><p>Queueing Systems Volume 1: Theory Leonard Kleinrock This book presents and develops methods from queueing theory in sufficient depth so that students and professionals may apply these methods to many modern engineering problems, as well as conduct creative research in the field. It provides a long-needed alternative both to highly mathematical texts and to those which are simplistic or limited in approach. Written in mathematical language, it avoids the "theorem-proof" technique: instead, it guides the reader through a step-by-step, intuitively motivated yet precise development leading to a natural discovery of results. Queueing Systems, Volume I covers material ranging from a refresher on transform and probability theory through the treatment of advanced queueing systems. It is divided into four sections: 1) preliminaries; 2) elementary queueing theory; 3) intermediate queueing theory; and 4) advanced material. Important features of Queueing Systems, Volume 1: Theory include-<br> * techniques of duality, collective marks<br> * queueing networks<br> * complete appendix on z-transforms and Laplace transforms<br> * an entire appendix on probability theory, providing the notation and main results needed throughout the text<br> * definition and use of a new and convenient graphical notation for describing the arrival and departure of customers to a queueing system<br> * a Venn diagram classification of many common stochastic processes<br> 1975 (0 471-49110-1) 417 pp. Fundamentals of Queueing Theory Second Edition Donald Gross and Carl M. Harris This graduated, meticulous look at queueing fundamentals developed from the authors' lecture notes presents all aspects of the methodology-including Simple Markovian birth-death queueing models; advanced Markovian models; networks, series, and cyclic queues; models with general arrival or service patterns; bounds, approximations, and numerical techniques; and simulation-in a style suitable to courses of study of widely varying depth and duration. This Second Edition features new expansions and abridgements which enhance pedagogical use: new material on numerical solution techniques for both steady-state and transient solutions; changes in simulation language and new results in statistical analysis; and more. Complete with a solutions manual, here is a comprehensive, rigorous introduction to the basics of the discipline. 1985 (0 471-89067-7) 640 pp.</p><p>Presents and develops methods from queueing theory in mathematical language and in sufficient depth so that the student may apply the methods to many modern engineering problems and conduct creative research. Step-by-step development of results with careful explanation, and lists of important results make it useful as a handbook and a text.Queueing Systems Volume 2: Computer Applications By Leonard Kleinrock In the early 60s queueing theory was found to be an effective tool for studying several performance parameters of computer systems. Since then, much of the queueing theory and computer applications literature has included analytical models for computer systems and computer networks. At present, queueing analysis of resource allocation and job flow through computer systems is one of the few tools available to computer scientists who wish to understand the behavior of the complex interconnections of their systems. It is chiefly for these reasons that this second volume of Queueing Systems uses the most recent and successful applications of queueing theory to show how theoretical tools must be modified to describe the reality of physical systems. For students who used the first volume as a textbook on queueing theory, Volume 2 provides the material for a second course on applications. For any professional in information processing and computer systems analysis it will prove to be an indispensable reference, since much of this material has never appeared in book form before. The author has taken particular care to organize the material for the smoothest possible transition from theory to application. Chapter 1 provides a queueing theory primer. For those who have not read the first volume or who have not had a previous course in queueing systems, this primer will be crucial to an adequate understanding of the book. To pass from queueing theory to applied results, Chapter 2 examines bounds, inequalities and approximations to capture the essential behavior of queueing systems, including transient and non-stationary behavior. Chapter 3 lays the groundwork for time-sharing studies by presenting basic notions of priority queueing systems. In Chapter 4, computer-time sharing and multiaccess systems are treated. Particular emphasis is placed on processorsharing algorithms, since they are singularly suited to queueing analysis and pave the way for more difficult and more complex algorithms used in scheduling problems. The new multiple resource models using queueing networks is also presented in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 focuses on the analysis and design of computer-communication networks using previous queueing theory results and additional network flow and optimization tools. A specific network, the Arpanet, is used throughout as an example to guide the reader through motivation and evaluation of the various techniques developed. Also treated are newer packetswitching concepts in satellite and ground radio communications. Chapter 6 continues the study of computer communication networks and focuses on simulation, measurement and Arpanet traps. Queueing Systems, Volume 2: Computer Applications is the second volume of a 2-volume set which constitutes a significant tool for solving many of today&#39;s information processing problems.

Lawrence</h2><p>Colonel T.E. Lawrence was one of the most flamboyant figures of his era, known throughout the Western world as Lawrence of Arabia. Glory-seeking yet self-effacing, this soldier, archaeologist, spy, and scholar was a war hero whom Winston Churchill called "one of the greatest men of our time." Less well known were his abilities as historian and author, which won him the admiration of such writers as Ezra Pound, W.H. Auden, and Robert Graves. <br> While stationed on a desolate R.A.F. outpost on the fringes of the Karachi desert in India, Lawrence began his acclaimed translation of <em>The Odyssey</em>. He devoted himself to the project for four years, and during that time he came to feel that he was uniquely suited to the task. "I have hunted wild boars and watched wild lions," he wrote. "Built boats and killed many men. So I have odd knowledges that qualify me to understand <em>The Odyssey</em>, and odd experiences that interpret it to me." Relying on an innate sense of language and truly gifted abilities at translation, Lawrence transformed Homer's <em>Odyssey</em> into mellifluous prose. The result was an overnight bestseller. <em>The New York Herald Tribune</em> hailed it "perhaps the most interesting translation of the world's most interesting book," and <em>The New York Times</em> called it "ruggedly and roughly masculine" and added that it "gives a vividness to the story beyond any other text familiar to us." <br> Lawrence breathes new life into the adventures of Odysseus, smoothing the reader's path through a fantastic array of monsters, temptresses, gods, and goddesses. For a generation of readers accustomed to verse translations of Homer, this bold and vivid prose version is well worth rediscovery.<br></p><p><br><strong>Bernard Knox</strong> is the retired Director of the Center for Hellenistic Studies and one of America's foremost classics scholars.

Working with the great quantum physicist Wolfgang Pauli, Jung sought to reveal these coincidences as phenomena that involve mind and matter, science and spirit, thus providing rational explanations for parapsychological events like telepathy, precognition, and intuition. Synchronicity examines the work of Jung and Pauli, as well as noted scientists Werner Heisenberg and David Bohm; identifies the phenomena in ancient and modern mythologies, particularly the Greek legend of Hermes the Trickster; and illustrates it with engaging anecdotes from everyday life and literature.</p><p><b>Allan Combs</b> is a professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina at Asheville and the Saybrook Graduate School in San Francisco, and he contributes to the Assisi Conferences on Carl Jung and self-organizing patterns in nature.

While the widening tolerance for same-sex marriage and for gay-themed media brings clear benefits, gay assimilation entails other losses--losses that have been hard to identify or mourn, since many aspects of historical gay culture are so closely associated with the pain and shame of the closet.</p><p><i>Feeling Backward</i> makes an effort to value aspects of historical gay experience that now threaten to disappear, branded as embarrassing evidence of the bad old days before Stonewall. It looks at early-twentieth-century queer novels often dismissed as "too depressing" and asks how we might value and reclaim the dark feelings that they represent. Heather Love argues that instead of moving on, we need to look backward and consider how this history continues to affect us in the present.</p><p>Through elegant readings of Walter Pater, Willa Cather, Radclyffe Hall, and Sylvia Townsend Warner, and through stimulating engagement with a range of critical sources, <i>Feeling Backward</i> argues for a form of politics attentive to social exclusion and its effects.</p></p><p>Heather Love is Associate Professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania.&#x201c;In supple readings of difficult, sometimes disturbing, yet always fascinating texts and contexts, Heather Love demonstrates that if we are to seriously engage with the queer past we must welcome the shame, fear, loneliness, obstinacy, and indeed backwardness that we encounter there. For all that, <i>Feeling Backward: Loss and the Politics of Queer History</i>, with its beautiful prose, stunning theoretical sophistication, careful attention to detail, as well as a hard-headed respect for the artists and critics whom it treats, is a stunningly hopeful book. Throughout Love links her critiques of celebratory queer criticism with a passionate concern for the opening up of progressive forms of intellectual and political life.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert F. Reid-Pharr, author of <i>Once You Go Black: Choice, Desire and the Black American Intellectual</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Heather Love is the Marcel Proust of contemporary theory. Disappointed love and tormented desire find a compassionate commentator in Love, who turns to queer history's tragic, lonely, and despairing figures, not to sublimate or to save them, but to recognize and to respect them. A wise, worldly, and winning book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Diana Fuss, Professor of English, Princeton University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Now that, in the latest twist of tolerance, gays are required to flaunt their well-adjustedness, <i>Feeling Backward</i> may feel backward indeed as it contemplates the pain, anger, isolation, and sheer crankiness, prominent in literary figures of our queer past. But it is harder than ever to pause for thought&#x2015;and not simply revulsion or compassion&#x2015;over these prickly and unwholesome feelings, which lead an increasingly closeted existence in ourselves. Heather Love is in astonishing possession of the negative capability required by her undertaking, and her analytic finesse proves well-matched to her ethical delicacy. This book&#x2015;together with the constellation of work it gathers around itself&#x2015;belongs to what may deservedly be called a new wave in queer studies.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>D.A. Miller, University of California, Berkeley</b><br><br>&#x201c;Like Lot's wife, I like to look over my shoulder too much at salty scenes from the shameful past-- though I've yet to turn into a pillar of the community. The delightfully named Heather Love makes all that hankering after pre-gay sex on Hampstead Heath seem slightly romantic and illuminates why and how the queer past is not always about waiting for Stonewall and disco to happen.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mark Simpson, Editor of <i>Anti-Gay</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;What does it mean to "feel backward"? By turning to, rather than away from, the texts of shame, injury, loss and failure that populate a queer past, Heather Love manages to shift queer studies away from the straight and narrow and back onto the slippery slope of stigma and dismay. Love refuses the triumphalist accounts of gay and lesbian progress and she insists on the spoiling of identity and on the political importance of "bad feelings." This is a rigorous book, a brave book, a wildly original and unrelenting book. It will be a central text in the backward future of queer studies.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Judith Halberstam, author of <i>In a Queer Time and Place</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;It seems to me this discontinuous book is a little bit like the stations of the cross. I mean if you like to stop, and most of us do. And sometimes the street was filled with us. All thinking about someone else. They are the past inside our present. He just put one in a cab. I like <i>Feeling Backward</i>... a lot.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Eileen Myles, poet</b><br><br>&#x201c;In this interesting study of modernist literature and the challenges of history, the author encourages readers to consider how early-20th-century moments once labeled embarrassing, troubling, and evil continue to have an affect. Drawing from the psychoanalysis of Jacques Lacan, the Marxist philosophy of Raymond Williams, and other schools of thought, Love rereads the works of Radclyffe Hall, Walter Pater, Willa Cather, and Sylvia Townsend Warner--often considered to turn away from an image of a brighter future for queer readers--in order to consider the "backward feelings" of shame, depression, and regret and describe how these texts have fallen into critical disrepute among queer theorists and scholars...This book is for those interested in the politics and history of emotion and sensibility.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>J. Pruitt</b><b>, </b><b><i>Choice</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Feeling Backward</i> is a brilliant work...Love looks fearlessly at literature from the past in which circumstances related to gender tend to produce victims rather than heroines. She establishes that our literature has been affected by homophobia and demands that we consider the implications of this fact. Love contends that we need to look at history and social politics less like Lot's wife, who's destroyed by looking back, and more like Odysseus, who listens to the past but isn't destroyed by it. The past haunts us whether we acknowledge it or not; we may be "looking forward," as we like to assure ourselves, even as we're "feeling backward."&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Martha Miller</b><b>, </b><b><i>Gay and Lesbian Review Worldwide</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Feeling Backward</i> is a brilliant book that attempts the "impossible" and succeeds. Using Michel Foucault and Eve Sedgwick as theoretical touchstones, and incorporating Raymond Williams's "structures of feeling," Heather Love "feels backward" to reimagine and connect with aspects of a queer past that had been rendered invisible. In doing so--in risking (as she puts it) the fate of Lot's wife in turning back to revisit a painful past--she embraces the ruins, the "fugitive dead," the loneliness and failures and all the "negative affect" that need to be reclaimed as part of that history...Love moves bravely backwards to that murky time, the "queer life before Stonewall," and then crosses the modernist line backwards to feel what has been lost. In doing so she has made a profoundly imaginative and powerful contribution to queer history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Rick Taylor</b><b>, </b><b><i>Feminist Review</i></b></p><h2>Morality and the Good Life: An Introduction to Ethics Through Classical Sources</h2><p>The premise of this ethical theory anthology is that the study of ethics represents, above all else, participation in the thinking of a long tradition of philosophers.

In <i>Subject to Display</i>, Jennifer Gonz�lez offers the first sustained analysis of their contribution, linking the history and legacy of race discourse to innovations in contemporary art. Race, writes Gonz�lez, is a social discourse that has a visual history. The collection and display of bodies, images, and artifacts in museums and elsewhere is a primary means by which a nation tells the story of its past and locates the cultures of its citizens in the present.</p><p>All five of the American installation artists Gonz�lez considers have explored the practice of putting human subjects and their cultures on display by staging elaborate dioramas or site-specific interventions in galleries and museums; in doing so, they have created powerful social commentary of the politics of space and the power of display in settings that mimic the very spaces they critique. These artists' installations have not only contributed to the transformation of contemporary art and museum culture, but also linked Latino, African American, and Native American subjects to the broader spectrum of historical colonialism, race dominance, and visual culture. From Luna's museum installation of his own body and belongings as &#x201c;artifacts&#x201d; and Wilson's provocative juxtapositions of museum objects to Mesa-Bains's allegorical home altars, Osorio's condensed spaces (bedrooms, living rooms; barbershops, prison cells) and Green's genealogies of cultural contact, the theoretical and critical endeavors of these artists demonstrate how race discourse is grounded in a visual technology of display.</p></p><p>Jennifer A.

Her essays and reviews have appeared in <i>Frieze, World Art, Diacritics, Art Journal, Bomb, </i> numerous exhibition catalogs, and anthologies, including <i>With Other Eyes: Looking at Race and Gender in Visual Culture</i> and <i>Race in Cyberspace.</i><p><i>Subject to Display</i> provides a historical record of a crucial body of visual art work and a theory of how this work effectively interrogates the formation of race in US culture. It also critiques the very terms through which 'identity' has been debated and often reified in both visual art practices and museum cultures. Subject to Display is an intelligent and crucial contribution to the understanding of racial discourse and visuality in late twentieth- and twenty-first century American culture.</p>&#x2015;<b>Amelia Jones</b>, Pilkington Chair, Art History &amp; Visual Studies, School ofArts, Histories and Cultures, University of Manchester (2009-01-01)<br><br><p>The intense moment of theorization of identity concepts developed in the nineties has apparently been brushed aside. Gonzalez provides a riveting response to the identity debate, making the case that it is time to refocus on its central questions. <i>Subject to Display</i> shows how certain artworks are capable of dismantling identity's monolithic qualities by interrogating the conditions under which identity has been created and sustained.</p>&#x2015;<b>Alexander Alberro</b>, author of <i>Conceptual Art and the Politics of Publicity</i><br><br><p>What better way to understand the agency of display than through a close reading of works that do what they are about.

Peter Brown describes how this shift transformed the Church&#x2019;s institutional relationship to money and set the stage for its domination of medieval society in the West.</p><p>Early Christian doctrine held that the living and the dead, as equally sinful beings, needed each other in order to achieve redemption. The devotional intercessions of the living could tip the balance between heaven and hell for the deceased. In the third century, money began to play a decisive role in these practices, as wealthy Christians took ever more elaborate steps to protect their own souls and the souls of their loved ones in the afterlife. They secured privileged burial sites and made lavish donations to churches. By the seventh century, Europe was dotted with richly endowed monasteries and funerary chapels displaying in marble splendor the Christian devotion of the wealthy dead.</p><p>In response to the growing influence of money, Church doctrine concerning the afterlife evolved from speculation to firm reality, and personal wealth in the pursuit of redemption led to extraordinary feats of architecture and acts of generosity. But it also prompted stormy debates about money&#x2019;s proper use&#x2015;debates that resonated through the centuries and kept alive the fundamental question of how heaven and earth could be joined by human agency.</p></p><p>Peter Brown is Philip and Beulah Rollins Professor of History, Emeritus, at Princeton University.&#x201c;In this visionary short study, <b>Peter Brown</b> links two themes which are rarely brought together: Christian views of the afterlife between the second and seventh centuries,and the way in which relations between God and the faithful, living and dead, were mediated by wealth... Beginning with the teaching of Jesus that one should give away what one has, Brown traces a trajectory of almsgiving over six centuries... Brown has rarely published a book without creating a new field of study and endowing it with new research questions, and here he does it again. This beautifully written volume which is eminently accessible to non-specialists holds special interest for Catholics. As it leads reader from the ancient into the early medieval world, it speaks especially to the evolution of Catholic tradition and doctrine... This is an absorbing, thought-provoking book, which prompts reflection on the modern as well as the ancient world, and on the secular as well as the religious sphere.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Teresa Morgan</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Tablet</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[An] extraordinary new book... The new work, which is one of [<b>Brown</b>&#x2019;s] shortest, is also prodigiously original&#x2015;an astonishing performance for a historian who has already been so prolific and influential... [It&#x2019;s] a completely fresh look at the issue of Christian wealth and giving, with special attention to changing perspectives from the mid-third century to the late seventh... [An] extraordinarily vivid panorama of money in the early church... Peter Brown&#x2019;s subtle and incisive tracking of the role of money in Christian attitudes toward the afterlife not only breaks down traditional geographical and chronological boundaries across more than four centuries. It provides wholly new perspectives on Christianity itself, its evolution, and, above all, its discontinuities. It demonstrates why the Middle Ages, when they finally arrived, were so very different from late antiquity.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>G. W. Bowersock</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The most erudite and elegant historian of Christian life in late antiquity... <b>Peter Brown</b> subtly explores the hopes and fears of those who lived through the revolution that was the spread of Christianity and the transformation of the ancient world into Christian Europe. Where many have seen almsgiving and charity as crass and mechanical exchanges, he sees in these charitable activities women and men imagining anew in perilous times the certainty of death and the uncertainty of its aftermath.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Miri Rubin</b><b>, </b><b><i>Literary Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[A] revelatory book... <i>The Ransom of the Soul</i> shows [<b>Brown</b>] to be as sparkling as ever; and it takes us, as his books always do, on a tour of depths that he is uniquely qualified to explore. The outward turn of events, be it the fall of empires or the founding of kingdoms, snarls and swirls on the surface like Neapolitan traffic; but deep underground, lit by flickering torches, there are frescoes, and ancient graves, and rows of skulls to be found. How fortunate we are to have Brown as our guide to them.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Tom Holland</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Statesman</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Brown</b> is one of those writers you could read at any length and still want more...

His latest book, relatively short in volume but very wide in scope, explores Christian attitudes to the afterlife, from the time of Cyprian of Carthage (martyred in 258) to that of Julian, Bishop of Toledo in the late seventh century... Brown shows brilliantly in this book how the future life of Christians beyond the grave was influenced in particular by money.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>A. N. Wilson</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Spectator</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;If historians resemble their subjects, <b>Peter Brown</b> is the first consul of late antiquity. Urbane and judicious, Brown has toured the tottering administrations of the provinces, taken the temperature of the Christian sects, and assessed the depredations of the barbarians. On his travels, Brown noticed that Latin Christians developed more elaborate theories on the afterlife than pagans, Jews, Muslims, or even Greek Christians. In <i>The Ransom of the Soul</i>, he explains why this happened, and how early Christian debates on the pneuma fostered the institutions of medieval Christendom. It is a brilliant and readable study in the kind of history that Nietzsche called the &#x2018;pneumatic interpretation.&#x2019;&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Dominic Green</b><b>, </b><b><i>Standpoint</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Thoroughly researched and deftly written, <b>Brown</b>&#x2019;s discussion provides a unique, valuable addition to historical and religious scholarship.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jennifer Harris</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In this brilliant, brief, and densely elegant study in the history of ideas, <b>Brown</b>, a renowned scholar of early Christian history, vividly illustrates the complex evolution of ideas about wealth and its role in the afterlife from the Christianity of the second century to the seventh century C.E.... Brown lucidly reveals the details and personalities of these centuries as he continually articulates the dynamic character of early Christianity.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Ransom of the Soul</i> is a splendid book connecting secular power, religious authority, and the fate of the soul through the later Roman Empire and into Early Medieval Europe. <b>Peter Brown</b> vivifies the imperative on the wealthy to pave their way to heaven by alms-giving and monetary support of the church. His study includes fascinating and sympathetic portraits of the principal figures and of the miracles and dreams that the bishops of the time incorporated in their sermons, to validate their dire accounts of the soul&#x2019;s afterlife. Religious history, philosophy, politics, and society are skillfully integrated here. This is a book for every kind of reader, while specialist historians will turn to it for its novel findings and impeccable research.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>A. A.

Watson needs a flat-mate and a diversion. Holmes needs a foil. And thus a great literary collaboration begins.<p> Watson and Holmes move to a now-famous address, 221B Baker Street, where Watson is introduced to Holmes's eccentricities as well as his uncanny ability to deduce information about his fellow beings. Somewhat shaken by Holmes's egotism, Watson is nonetheless dazzled by his seemingly magical ability to provide detailed information about a man glimpsed once under the streetlamp across the road. </p><p> Then murder. Facing a deserted house, a twisted corpse with no wounds, a mysterious phrase drawn in blood on the wall, and the buffoons of Scotland Yard--Lestrade and Gregson--Holmes measures, observes, picks up a pinch of this and a pinch of that, and generally baffles his faithful Watson. Later, Holmes explains: "In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backward.... There are few people who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result." Holmes is in that elite group. </p><p> Conan Doyle quickly learned that it was Holmes's deductions that were of most interest to his readers. The lengthy flashback, while a convention of popular fiction, simply distracted from readers' real focus. It is when Holmes and Watson gather before the coal fire and Holmes sums up the deductions that led him to the successful apprehension of the criminal that we are most captivated. Subsequent Holmes stories--<i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i>, <i>The Return of Sherlock Holmes</i>, and <i>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</i>--rightly plunge the twosome directly into the middle of a baffling crime, piling mystery upon mystery until Holmes's denouement once more leaves the dazzled Watson murmuring, "You are wonderful, Holmes!"

With Hickey as our guide, we travel to Disneyland and Vegas, London and Venice. We discover the genius of Karen Carpenter and Waylon Jennings, learn why Robert Mitchum matters more than Jimmy Stewart, and see how the stillness of Antonioni speaks to us today. Never slow to judge&#x2014;or to surprise us in doing so&#x2014;Hickey powerfully relates his wincing disappointment in the later career of his early hero Susan Sontag, and shows us the appeal to our commonality that we&#x2019;ve been missing in Norman Rockwell.

We are presented with an age of vitality, where historians used to find a creeping paralysis; the canvas comes alive with the spectacular successes of individuals who belie the conventional wisdom of the stifling oppressiveness of late Roman institutions; and the cautious uncertainty of the &#x2018;age of anxiety&#x2019; disappears in a vigorous emphasis on the recognition and display of power... In a book devoted to human beings it is the portraits of individuals, perceptively located in their social and religious surroundings, which are naturally to the fore. [Brown] has shifted the emphasis of late Roman studies from institutions to individuals, and to the discernment of what made late antique men &#x2018;tick&#x2019;&#x2015;a task for which he is without equal.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>E. D. Hunt</b><b>, </b><b><i>Classical Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Making of Late Antiquity</i> is most successful, I think, as a study of shifts in the religious imagination... Brown is sensitive to the multifaceted quality of the Late Antique view of the soul, and some of his most creative work is in discussions of demons and angels as imaginal faces of the self and its changing relation to the holy. From the private dreams of Aristides to the public withdrawal of Anthony, Brown has sketched a remarkable shift in a culture&#x2019;s vision of itself.

Though well written and at times illuminating, his perspective is seldom self-critical and often reveals how detached he was from the decision-making process.

Rhyming poems and books are ruined when Word Harmony matches words that don&#x2019;t rhyme.The royal English children invite students to become fellow grammar guardians in order to save the galaxy from crises like these. After teachers read one of the mysteries to their students from the separate text, young guardians complete a corresponding mission with three short steps in this manual. The Grammar Galaxy: Nebula Mission Manual is especially appropriate for first and second graders who are beginning to read and write. Missions for Advanced Guardians make it flexible enough to use with students through sixth grade. Missions cover: *reading skill development *literary concepts *vocabulary *spelling *grammar *composition and *speaking The Grammar Galaxy: Nebula Mission Manual is a great choice for homeschoolers, teachers, and parents: *Whose student has begun to read and write (use a good phonics and handwriting program first) *Who want their student to have excellent reading, writing, and speaking skills *Who want their student to spend less time doing seat work and more time reading and writing.</p><p>Dr. Melanie Wilson was a clinical psychologist working in a Christian practice, a college instructor, freelance writer, and public speaker before she felt called to stay home and educate her children.

Aristocrat and natural philosopher, he was a remarkably wide-ranging and penetrating thinker&#x2014;pioneering the modern experimental method, championing a novel mechanical view of nature, and reflecting deeply on philosophical and theological issues related to science. But, as Michael Hunter shows, Boyle was also a complex and contradictory personality, fascinated by alchemy and magic and privately plagued with doubts about faith and conscience, which troubled the rational vision he heralded. </p><p>This extraordinary work is the first biography of Boyle in a generation, and the culminating achievement of a world-renowned expert on the scientist. Deftly navigating Boyle&#x2019;s voluminous published works as well as his personal letters and papers, Hunter&#x2019;s complete and intimate account gives us the man rather than myth, the troubled introvert as well as the public campaigner. Lively, perceptive, and full of original insights, this is the definitive account of a remarkable man and the changing world in which he lived.</p></p><p>A renowned world expert on Robert Boyle, <b>Michael Hunter</b> is professor of history, Birkbeck College, University of London.&#34;&#39;A comprehensive account of Boyle&#39;s life that incorporates all the latest research...

The Iliad, which tells of the siege of Troy by the Greeks, is an unforgettable tale of nations at war and of the courage and compassion heroic soldiers show upon the field of battle. The Odyssey is the story of the Greek hero Odysseus and the many marvels and challenges he encounters during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the end of the Trojan War.

Fashionably dressed, the charismatic but deeply flawed Shelby family blind enemies by slashing them with the disposable safety razor blades stitched in to the peaks of their flat caps, as they fight bloody gangland wars involving Irish terrorists and the authorities led by a devious Home Secretary, Winston Churchill.<br><br>But who were the real Peaky Blinders? Did they really exist? <br><br>Well-known social historian, broadcaster and author, Carl Chinn, has spent decades searching them out. Now he reveals the true story of the notorious Peaky Blinders, one of whom was his own great grandfather and, like the Shelbys, his grandfather was an illegal bookmaker in back-street Birmingham. <br><br>In this gripping social history, Chinn shines a light on the rarely reported struggles of the working class in one of the great cities of the British Empire before the First World War. The story continues after 1918 as some Peaky Blinders transformed into the infamous Birmingham Gang. Led by the real Billy Kimber, they fought a bloody war with the London gangsters Darby Sabini and Alfie Solomon over valuable protection rackets extorting money from bookmakers across the booming postwar racecourses of Britain.<br><br>Drawing together a remarkably wide-range of original sources, including rarely seen images of real Peaky Blinders and interviews with relatives of the 1920s gangsters, Peaky Blinders: The Real Story adds a new dimension to the true history of Birmingham's underworld and fact behind its fiction.</p><p></p><h2>Ancient Forests</h2><p>In this collection of over 120 beautiful, full-color photographs, naturalist David Middleton reveals the full scope of forest life, from Alaska to California, from the mountains to the coastlines. Detailed captions and informative text accompany the photographs.</p><p>Middleton, a photographer and freelance writer, offers a feast of colorful, informative scenes from the endangered old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest. These forests are hundreds of years old and include massive redwood, Sitka spruce and Douglas fir trees. The striking photographs aim less to thrill than to enlighten the reader about the forest's complex ecosystem: dead trees are just as important as live ones, allowing light to penetrate so young trees can grow, and all varieties of life, from fungi to insects, birds and bobcat, have their place. The northern spotted owl, Middleton writes, "has unwittingly become the surrogate for the old-growth forest," because its status as a threatened species led to calls for forest protection. Middleton's three-chapter text could be more comprehensive and sometimes blends awkwardly with the photographs, but it ultimately contributes to a gently persuasive book. Though acknowledging the importance of the logging industry, Middleton argues that the most economical way to produce wood, known as clear-cutting, shouldn't overshadow "the ecological, recreational, spiritual, and emotional values of the ancient forest." <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Social Work Practicum: A Guide and Workbook for Students</h2><p>Social Work Practicum, 5/e, offers a unique integrative format designed to help students develop social work competencies by applying their academic learning to practicum experiences.

The authors propose that the twentieth century was not only the American Century but also the Human Capital Century. That is, the American educational system is what made America the richest nation in the world. Its educational system had always been less elite than that of most European nations. By 1900 the U.S. had begun to educate its masses at the secondary level, not just in the primary schools that had remarkable success in the nineteenth century. </p><p> The book argues that technological change, education, and inequality have been involved in a kind of race. During the first eight decades of the twentieth century, the increase of educated workers was higher than the demand for them. This had the effect of boosting income for most people and lowering inequality. However, the reverse has been true since about 1980. This educational slow-down was accompanied by rising inequality. The authors discuss the complex reasons for this, and what might be done to ameliorate it. </p></p><p><b>Claudia Goldin</b> is &#xfeff;Henry Lee Professor of Economics at Harvard University.If you want to understand the causes of the innovation deficit, I&#x2019;d recommend adding one serious book to your summer reading list: <i>The Race Between Education and Technology</i>.

This alone would make their book essential reading. Yet they also offer a powerful explanation for what has driven changes in income inequality and point to solutions for addressing it...The good news is that if Goldin and Katz are right, the cure for income inequality is one most Americans would intuitively support: improving mass education.

Kristof <i>New York Times</i> 2008-11-13)<br><br>Masterful...As the book's title suggests, whether inequality increases or not is best thought of as an ongoing race between education and technology. Combining this simple but appealing idea with a deep knowledge of the histories of the U.S. labor market and educational institutions, Goldin and Katz conclude that whereas education was winning the race for most of the 20th century, technology caught up in the 1970s and has since prevailed. The authors' most insightful point is that the root cause of the recent growth in inequality is not faster technological progress during the past three decades but rather the surprising stagnation in the level of education of young Americans. (Thomas Lemieux <i>Science</i> 2008-09-26)<br><br><i>The Race Between Education and Technology</i> contains many tables, a few equations and a powerfully told story about how and why the United States became the world's richest nation--namely, thanks to its schools...Beginning in the 1970s, however, the education system failed to keep pace, resulting, Ms. Goldin and Mr. Katz contend, in a sharply unequal nation...It is nice to be reminded, in a data-rich book, that greater investments in human capital once put Americans collectively on top of the world.

Finally, this view of God and the evolving world yields implications for our understanding of human action. Moral agency, even God's work of redemption, unfolds according to an ethic of risk rather than by the quick fix of determinative control.</p></p><p>Cynthia Crysdale is professor of Christian ethics and theology at the School of Theology at the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee.

Debates about his meaning have deflected attention from his personality, yet his personality is an important key to understanding his theological ideas. This book redresses the balance. Jerome Murphy-O'Connor's disciplined imagination, nourished by a lifetime of research, shapes numerous textual, historical, and archaeological details into a colourful and enjoyable story of which Paul is the flawed but undefeated hero.<br> This chronological narrative offers new insights into Paul's intellectual, emotional, and religious development and puts his travels, mission, and theological ideas into a plausible biographical context. As he changes from an assimilated Jewish teenager in Tarsus to a competitive Pharisee in Jerusalem and then to a driven missionary of Christ, the sometimes contradictory components of Paul's complex personality emerge from the way he interacts with people and problems. His theology was forged in dialogue and becomes more intelligible as our appreciation of his person deepens. In Jerome Murphy-O'Connor's engaging biography, the Apostle comes to life as a complex, intensely human individual.<br><br></p><p><br><strong>Jerome Murphy-O'Connor</strong> is Professor of New Testament at the �cole Biblique et Arch�ologique Fran�aise, Jerusalem.<br>Murphy-O'Connor, a noted Pauline scholar, professor of New Testament at the Ecole Biblique et Archeologique Francais in Jerusalem and author of a previous work on the life of Paul, approaches the apostle from a critical and academic standpoint.

O'Connor draws from Paul's letters hints and shades of meaning that assist the reader in forming a consistent view of a sometimes conflicted but always fervent servant of God. The book is replete with conclusions drawn from inference, but the inferences are reasonable, and taken together, put flesh on the man. Beginning with Paul's childhood, and following him through his travels and finally to his death, Murphy-O'Connor brings Paul to life as a real person with real passions. The author nimbly handles aspects of Paul's teachings that have generated controversy, such as his views on the Jewish law or the leadership role of women. Written at a popular level, this book will be helpful as enrichment for the lay reader. Critical issues such as authorship, translation, sources and textual accuracy are mentioned only as they fit into the larger context of Paul, the man. Several maps depict the travels of Paul, and a suggested reading list offers guidance for further study. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Fulghum writes to his fellow travelers, with a sometimes light heart, about the deep and vexing mysteries of being alive and says, "This is my way of bringing the small boat of my life within speaking distance of yours.&nbsp; Hello..."&nbsp;</p><p>ROBERT FULGHUM is the bestselling author of All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten and numerous other books. He grew up in Waco, TX. He now divides his time among Seattle, Utah, and Crete.Twenty years after his All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten became a record-breaking bestseller, Fulghum's authorial voice is still distinctive and his tone welcomingly upbeat, but this new collection of short pieces suffers from self-indulgence, roping in too many vague and inconsequential essays. The majority of the book falls into three sections, one for each of Fulghum's homes-Seattle, Moab, Utah and the island of Crete-and the strongest section is the Cretan, containing some lovely, incisive essays on his indomitable Greek housekeeper, "The Invincible Ioannoulla." Elsewhere his writing is well-meaning but feather-light while taking on topics like holidays, history, "players" and the conversations of strangers; even in the midst of terminal naivety, however, Fulghum's able to land an unexpected, resonant thought: "I walked on with the dog of my imagination running unleashed through the bushes of my brain, looking for a place to unload." Though these worthwhile passages and brief, shining moments make Fulghum's dissolution into wispy koans ("Go on. Escape over the walls of your asylum.") all the more disappointing, fans of Fulghum's storytelling will find much to savor. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

So when he&#x2019;s recruited by Calvin Pine&#x2014;an enigmatic American investigator for the war crimes tribunal at The Hague&#x2014;to join a search mission back in the ruins of his homeland, he finds it hard to resist. They&#x2019;re seeking a general responsible for the massacre at Srebrenica, but Petric is also being offered as bait to lure another suspect whose activities in World War II make the current generation of killers look like amateurs. Getting hotter on a trail that eventually leads across Europe, Petric soon finds that great political powers make unsavory alliances, and that investigating the mysteries of the past can be as dangerous as navigating the war zones of the present.<br><br>A gripping novel about legends and lies, about great deceptions and personal truths, <i>The Small Boat of Great Sorrows</i> is a galvanizing detective novel in a vein that brilliantly transcends the genre.</p><p>"Deft and gripping. . . .

"A generous collection with a distinctly upbeat tone, this gives a taste of the best poets writing for children over the last several decades. Lobel's drawings imbue the whole with action and graphic images as inventive as the verse. Successfully geared to meet home, school, and library needs."--(starred) <i>Booklist.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i>The Random House Book of Poetry for Children</i> was recognized upon its publication in 1983 as an invaluable collection--a modern classic--and it has not since been surpassed. Five hundred poems, selected by poet and anthologist Jack Prelutsky, are divided into broad subject areas such as nature, seasons, living things, children, and home. The poems of Emily Dickinson, Robert Louis Stevenson, Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Nikki Giovanni, and Gwendolyn Brooks populate the book's pages, while Lewis Carroll, Edward Lear, Ogden Nash, and Shel Silverstein ensure that the collection delights even the most reluctant readers of rhyme. Playground chants, anonymous rhymes, scary poems, silly verse, and even some sad strains are carefully indexed by title, author, first line, and subject. With illustrations of cheerful, round-faced children and animals on every page, Arnold Lobel (a Caldecott medalist and creator of the Frog and Toad series) unifies the diverse poems to form a satisfying whole; Lobel can draw anything and make it funny--or poignant, if he chooses. This collection, one of the most varied and complete around, will carry any budding poetry lover through childhood and beyond.

The best part is when he pulls out the most intriguing facts and figures into two or three well-illustrated sidebars. A survey that does justice to the data, but could have been formatted with more visuals and less text. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>Dragon&#39;s Lair</h2><p>When her beloved son Richard is imprisoned and held for ransom in an Austrian dungeon and the hated Prince John plots with King Phillippe of France to prevent Richard&#39;s return, Queen Eleanor sends Justin de Quincy into Wales to recover a ransom payment that has gone missing. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>July 1193.

He lives with his wife and two children in Hertfordshire, England.</p><i>Chapter One</i><br>ON A SPRING DAY in his twelfth year, Temujin raced his four brothers across the steppes, in the shadow of the mountain known as Deli&#x2019;un-Boldakh. The eldest, Bekter, rode a gray mare with skill and concentration, and Temujin matched his pace, waiting for a chance to go past. Behind them came Khasar, whooping wildly as he moved up on the two leaders. At ten, Khasar was a favorite in the tribe, as lighthearted as Bekter was sullen and dark. His red-mottled stallion snorted and whickered after Bekter&#x2019;s mare, making the little boy laugh. Kachiun came next in the galloping line, an eight-year-old not given to the openness that made people love Khasar. Of all of them, Kachiun seemed the most serious, even secretive. He spoke only rarely and did not complain, no matter what Bekter did to him. Kachiun had a knack with the ponies that few others could match, able to nurse a burst of speed when the rest were flagging. Temujin glanced over his shoulder to where Kachiun had positioned himself, his balance perfect. He seemed to be idling along, but they had all been surprised before and Temujin kept a close eye on him.<br><br>Already some way behind his brothers, the smallest and youngest of them could be heard calling plaintively for them to wait. Temuge was a boy with too much love for sweet things and laziness, and it showed in his riding. Temujin grinned at the sight of the chubby boy flapping his arms for more speed. Their mother had warned against including the youngest in their wild tournaments. Temuge had barely grown out of the need to be tied to the saddle, but he wailed if they left him behind. Bekter had yet to find a kind word for Temuge.<br><br>Their high voices carried far across the spring grass of the plain. They galloped flat out, with each boy perched like a bird on the ponies&#x2019; backs. Yesugei had once called them his sparrows and looked on with pride at their skill. Temujin had told Bekter that he was too fat to be a sparrow and had been forced to spend a night hiding out from the older boy&#x2019;s bad temper.<br><br>On such a day, though, the mood of the whole tribe was light. The spring rains had come and the rivers ran full again, winding across plains where dry clay had been only days before. The mares had warm milk for drinking and making into cheese and cool yoghurt. Already, the first touches of green were showing through the bones of the hills, and with it came the promise of a summer and warm days. It was a gathering year, and before the next winter, the tribes would come together in peace to compete and trade. Yesugei had decreed that this year the families of the Wolves would make the trip of more than a thousand miles to replenish their herds. The prospect of seeing the wrestlers and archers was enough to have the boys on their best behavior. The races, though, were what held them rapt and played across their imaginations as they rode. Except for Bekter, the boys had all seen their mother privately, asking Hoelun to put in a word with Yesugei. Each of them wanted to race the long distance or the sprints, to make a name for themselves and be honored.<br><br>It went unspoken that a boy who returned to his gers with a title such as &#x201c;Exalted Rider&#x201d; or &#x201c;Master of Horse&#x201d; might one day win their father&#x2019;s position when he retired to tend his herds. With the possible exception of fat Temuge, the others could not help but dream. It galled Temujin that Bekter assumed he would be the one, as if a year or two of age made a difference. Their relationship had become strained ever since Bekter had returned from his betrothal year away from the tribe. Though Temujin was still the tallest of the brothers, the older boy had grown in some indefinable way, and Temujin had found the new Bekter a humorless companion.<br><br>It had seemed an act at first to Temujin, with Bekter only pretending at maturity. The brooding boy no longer spoke without thinking and seemed to weigh every statement in his mind before he allowed it past his lips. Temujin had mocked his seriousness, but the months of winter had come and gone with no sign of an easing. There were moments when Temujin still found his brother&#x2019;s pompous moods amusing, but he could respect Bekter&#x2019;s temper, if not his right to inherit their father&#x2019;s tents and sword.<br><br>Temujin watched Bekter as he rode, careful not to let a gap grow between them. It was too fine a day to worry about the distant future, and Temujin daydreamed about all four brothers, brothers&#x2013;all five with Bekter, even&#x2013;sweeping the board of honors at the tribal gathering. Yesugei would swell with pride and Hoelun would grip them one by one and call them her little warriors, her little horsemen. Even Temuge could be entered at six years of age, though the risks of a fall were huge. Temujin frowned to himself as Bekter glanced over his shoulder, checking his lead. Despite their subtle maneuvering, Yesugei had not yet given permission for any of them to take part as the spring came.<br><br>Hoelun was pregnant again and close to the end of her time. The pregnancy had been hard on her and quite different from the ones before. Each day began and ended with her retching over a bucket until her face was speckled with spots of blood under the skin. Her sons were on their best behavior while they waited for Yesugei to cease his worried pacing outside the gers. In the end, the khan had grown tired of their stares and careful silence, sending them off to run the winter out of the horses. Temujin had continued to chatter and Yesugei had picked him up in one powerful hand and tossed him at a stallion with a white sock. Temujin had twisted in the air to land and launch into a gallop in one movement. Whitefoot was a baleful, snappy beast, but his father had known he was the boy&#x2019;s favorite.<br><br>Yesugei had watched the others mount without a sign of his pride on his broad, dark face. Like his father before him, he was not a man to show emotion, especially not to sons he could make weak. It was part of a father&#x2019;s responsibility to be feared, though there were times when he ached to hug the boys and throw them up into the air. Knowing which horses they preferred showed his affection, and if they guessed at his feelings from a glance or a light in his eye, that was no more than his own father had done years before. He valued those memories in part for their rarity and could still recall the time his father had finally grunted approval at his knots and ropework with a heavy load. It was a small thing, but Yesugei thought of the old man whenever he yanked a rope tight, his knee hard into the bales. He watched his boys ride into the bright sunshine, and when they could no longer see him, his expression eased. His father had known the need for hard men in a hard land. Yesugei knew they would have to survive battle, thirst, and hunger if they were to reach manhood. Only one could be khan of the tribe. The others would either bend the knee or leave with just a wanderer&#x2019;s gift of goats and sheep. Yesugei shook his head at the thought, gazing after the dust trail of his sons&#x2019; ponies. The future loomed over them, while they saw only the spring and the green hills.<br><br>The sun was bright on his face as Temujin galloped. He reveled in the lift in spirit that came from a fast horse straining under him, the wind in his face. Ahead, he saw Bekter&#x2019;s gray mare recover from a stumble on a loose stone. His brother reacted with a sharp blow to the side of the mare&#x2019;s head, but they had lost a length and Temujin whooped as if he were about to ride past. It was not the right moment. He loved to lead, but he also enjoyed pressuring Bekter, because of the way it annoyed him.<br><br>Bekter was already almost the man he would be, with wide, muscular shoulders and immense stamina. His betrothal year with the Olkhun&#x2019;ut people had given him an aura of worldly knowledge he never failed to exploit. It irritated Temujin like a thorn under his skin, especially when his brothers pestered Bekter with questions about their mother&#x2019;s people and their customs. Temujin too wanted to know, but he decided grimly that he would wait to find out on his own, when Yesugei took him.<br><br>When a young warrior returned from his wife&#x2019;s tribe, he was given the status of a man for the first time. When the girl came into her blood, she would be sent after him with an honor guard to show her value. A ger would be ready for her and her young husband would wait at its door to take her inside.<br><br>For the Wolves, it was tradition for the young man to challenge his khan&#x2019;s bondsmen before he was fully accepted as a warrior. Bekter had been eager and Temujin remembered watching in awe as Bekter had walked up to the bondsmen&#x2019;s fire, close to Yesugei&#x2019;s ger. Bekter had nodded to them and three men had stood to see if his time with the Olkhun&#x2019;ut had weakened him. From the shadows, Temujin had watched, with Khasar and Kachiun silent at his side. Bekter had wrestled all three of the bondsmen, one after the other, taking terrible punishment without complaint. Eeluk had been the last, and the man was like a pony himself, a wall of flat muscle and wide arms. He had thrown Bekter so hard that blood had run from one of his ears, but then to Temujin&#x2019;s surprise, Eeluk had helped Bekter up and held a cup of hot black <i>airag </i>for him to drink. Bekter had almost choked at the bitter fluid mingling with his own blood, but the warriors had not seemed to mind.<br><br>Temujin had enjoyed witnessing his older brother beaten almost senseless, but he saw too that the men no longer scorned him around the fires at night. Bekter&#x2019;s courage had won him something intangible but important. As a result, he had become a stone in Temujin&#x2019;s path. As the brothers raced across the plains under a spring sun, there was no finishing line, as there would be at the great gathering of tribes. Even if there had been, it was too soon after winter to really push their mounts. They all knew better than to exhaust the ponies before they had ...</p><h2>The Death of Kings (Emperor, Book 2)</h2><p><b>From the author of the bestselling <i>The Dangerous Book for Boys</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br>&#x201c;Brilliant...stunning,&#x201d; raved the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> about Conn Iggulden&#x2019;s first novel,<b> Emperor: The Gates of Rome</b>. &#x201c;Iggulden is a grand storyteller,&#x201d; declared USA Today.

A bastion of freedom and the capital of Black America, Harlem's twentieth century renaissance changed our arts, culture, and politics forever. But this is only one of the many chapters in a wonderfully rich and varied history. In <i>Harlem</i>, historian Jonathan Gill presents the first complete chronicle of this remarkable place.<br><br>From Henry Hudson's first contact with native Harlemites, through Harlem's years as a colonial outpost on the edge of the known world, Gill traces the neighborhood's story, marshaling a tremendous wealth of detail and a host of fascinating figures from George Washington to Langston Hughes. Harlem was an agricultural center under British rule and the site of a key early battle in the Revolutionary War. Later, wealthy elites including Alexander Hamilton built great estates there for entertainment and respite from the epidemics ravaging downtown. In the nineteenth century, transportation urbanized Harlem and brought waves of immigrants from Germany, Italy, Ireland, and elsewhere. Harlem's mix of cultures, extraordinary wealth and extreme poverty was electrifying and explosive.<br><br>Extensively researched, impressively synthesized, eminently readable, and overflowing with captivating characters, <i>Harlem</i> is an ambitious, sweeping history, and an impressive achievement.</p><p><p>James Patrick Cronin is an accomplished audiobook narrator with over 100 titles to his credit. A classically trained stage actor with an MFA from the University of Louisville, he has performed as an actor and a comedian on stages all over the world.</p><b>Praise for <i>Harlem</i></b><br><br> The ancient bones of Harlem are bared, and its old Dutch farmhouses are uncovered, and the forgotten cattle in the pastures shake away a long-settled dust. In this retrospection, something remarkable happens. Page after page of Gill&#x2019;s book removes brick after brick of the hulking substance of Harlem, paring it back through the jazz and the riots and the poetry to its ancient hours, until a quiet nothingness is left, and the place at last makes sense.&#x201d; <i>The New York Times</i><br><br>"An epic worthy of its fabled subject.&#x201d; Edward Kosner, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>"Comprehensive and compassionate an essential text of American history and culture." <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (starred review)<br><br> Kudos to Jonathan Gill for this savvy reconstruction of Harlem&#x2019;s long, complicated, and often vexing history. A terrific read, with plenty of surprises along the way, it&#x2019;s bound to become a classic or I&#x2019;ll eat my hat.&#x201d; Edwin G. Burrows, Pulitzer Prize-winning co-author of <i>Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898</i><br><br> Authoritative and exhaustive, in addition to being well-written and perceptive We are in Gill's debt for digging so deeply into Harlem's past, for describing it with no agenda beyond thoroughness and fairness, and for reminding us that there is so much in Harlem to honor and celebrate as well as to deplore and lament. It is one of the most significant neighborhoods in the country, and its contributions - in social leadership, in literature and the arts - have been huge and invaluable." Jonathan Yardley, <i>The Washington Post</i><br><br> An exquisitely detailed account of the 400-year history of Harlem. Gill details major figures from George Washington and Alexander Hamilton to Langston Hughes, Marcus Garvey, and Malcolm X as well as the vibrancy of music, art, literature, religion, politics, and urban sensibility that has come to signify Harlem. Richly researched a vibrant, well-paced, engaging history of an iconic neighborhood.&#x201d; <i>Booklist</i> (starred review)<br><br> Jonathan Gill writes with a novelist&#x2019;s bold feel for character, landscape and the struggle of powerful interests. He is the perhaps first historian to grasp the full significance of uptown&#x2019; New York City, and shows how the pious, conservative and deeply rural Harlem resisted the corruption and conflicts of downtown,&#x2019; and then was transformed by industry, the railroad, the subway and by successive waves of immigrants. Harlem was re-made by African-Americans in the twentieth century, who created a new culture within the swirling, complexity of New York City. Gill&#x2019;s Harlem, told in vivid detail, began as a rural village and became the site of the greatest avant-garde in American culture.&#x201d; Eric Homberger, author of <i>The Historical Atlas of New York City</i><br><br>"Jonathan Gill's history of Harlem is so briskly paced and invitingly written that readers may not even notice how deeply and impeccably researched it is." John Matteson, Pulitzer-Prize winning author of <i>Eden&#x2019;s Outcasts</i><br><br> Jonathan Gill has given us the most appealing trip to Harlem since Duke Ellington told Billy Strayhorn to "take the a train." Gill's gallantly researched, lovingly detailed cakewalk through the history of one of the world's great neighborhoods brings all the streets, pols, gangsters, hoopsters and hipsters vividly to life.&#x201d; Nicholas Dawidoff<br><br> Over the years there have been a number of books addressing the Harlem Renaissance. But very few examined the years before or after that remarkable phase. Jonathan Gill has made a decisive and successful step in that direction. ...

Long considered the rightful successor to the mantles of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, Ross Macdonald and his Lew Archer-novels were hailed by The New York Times as &#34;the finest series of detective novels ever written by an American.&#34; Now, in the first full-length biography of this extraordinary and influential writer, a much fuller picture emerges of a man to whom hiding things came as second nature. While it was no secret that Ross Macdonald was the pseudonym of Kenneth Millar -- a Santa Barbara man married to another good mystery writer, Margaret Millar -- his official biography was spare. Drawing on unrestricted access to the Kenneth and Margaret Millar Archives, on more than forty years of correspondence, and on hundreds of interviews with those who knew Millar well, author Tom Nolan has done a masterful job of filling in the blanks between the psychologically complex novels and the author&#39;s life -- both secret and overt. Ross Macdonald came to crime-writing honestly. Born in northern California to Canadian parents, Kenneth Millar grew up in Ontario virtually fatherless, poor, and with a mother whose mental stability was very much in question. From the age of twelve, young Millar was fighting, stealing, and breaking social and moral laws; by his own admission, he barely escaped being a criminal. Years later, Millar would come to see himself in his tales&#39; wrongdoers. &#34;I don&#39;t have to be violent,&#34; he said, &#34;My books are.&#34; How this troubled young man came to be one of the most brilliant graduate students in the history of the University of Michigan and how this writer, who excelled in a genre all too often looked down upon by literary critics, came to have a lifelong friendship with Eudora Welty are all examined in the pages of Tom Nolan&#39;s meticulous biography. We come to a sympathetic understanding of the Millars&#39; long, and sometimes rancorous, marriage and of their life in Santa Barbara, California, with their only daughter, Linda, whose legal and emotional traumas lie at the very heart of the story. But we also follow the trajectory of a literary career that began in the pages of Manhunt and ended with the great respect of such fellow writers as Marshall McLuhan, Hugh Kenner, Nelson Algren, and Reynolds Price, and the longtime distinguished publisher Alfred A. Knopf. As Ross Macdonald: A Biography makes abundantly clear, Ross Macdonald&#39;s greatest character -- above and beyond his famous Lew Archer -- was none other than his creator, Kenneth Millar.</p><p>More caring than Chandler, more productive than Hammett, Ross Macdonald was arguably America's best crime novelist, and Tom Nolan--who has been working on this large and impressive biography since its subject's death in 1983--makes that argument eloquently. With great energy and considerable art, he captures the essence of a remarkable man, born Kenneth Millar, as his life moved from a bleak, tormented childhood in the wilds of Canada, through an uncertain love-hate relationship with the world of academia, and then to early struggles, growing success, and family tragedy on the golden shores of California.<p> Along the way, Nolan charts one of the most unusual literary marriages in recent memory, to fellow mystery writer Margaret Millar--a working relationship so carefully protected and circumscribed that it probably did irrevocable damage to their only child. The author also enlivens the usually dreary details of a writer's financial life with shafts of brilliant insight, especially into the strange relationship between Macdonald and his lifelong publisher, Alfred Knopf, who Margaret aptly describes as "a troubled and a troubling man."</p><p> But perhaps Nolan's most impressive achievement is in showing exactly how and why the murder mystery became a worthy medium for some of the world's smartest people who read and write in the form.

The Biography of Michelangelo&#39;s David</h2><p>Michelangelo&#39;s David is the world s most famous statue, a universal symbol of Florence and of Italy. Hailed as the epitome of Renaissance art, the David has inspired contemporary artists from Warhol to Banksy and has been reproduced in life-size copies all over the globe. Why does a 500-year-old statue of a religious figure continue to resonate so deeply today? The answer lies in the captivating story of Michelangelo s David. It is a tale rich in conflict, tension, controversy and cultural meaning. Author Victor Coonin tells this story not as ancient history but as a centuries-long biography right up to the present day. What started simply as a monumental block of Carrara marble took on new vigour in Michelangelo s gifted hands. The statue is both life-like and larger than life: an embodiment of human accomplishment, of perfection, magnificence and beauty. The David has a life of his own, and this life succeeds in telling us something about ourselves.</p><p>A. Victor Coonin is James F. Ruffin Chair of Art at Rhodes College. He has received fellowships and grants from the Mellon, Kress, and Fullbright foundations and has served on committees for the Fullbright, National Endowment for the Humanities, and College Art Association. Author of numerous articles and editor of 2 books, this is his first monograph.The story of Michelangelo s David begins long before Michelangelo ever set chisel to stone. The gigantic block of Carrara marble that was to become the David was quarried more than half a century before anyone saw the statue set up in Florence s piazza della Signoria. And in between, there s a litany of contracts, artists and projects in different media while the patrons, the Operai del Duomo, searched for perfection, and finally got it from Michelangelo. The life of David takes unexpected turns in later centuries. It has been seriously damaged several times both intentionally and by accident. Controversies and scandals erupted in the 19th century as the statue was almost destroyed by cleaning with acid and then moved for safeguarding to the Accademia Gallery. In the 20th and 21st centuries he s become an artistic and popular icon as well as a symbol of Italy. The story of David is rich in conflict, tension, controversy and cultural meaning. Author Victor Coonin tells this story not as ancient history but as a centuries-long biography right up to the present day. What started as a monumental block of Carrara marble took on new vigour in Michelangelo s gifted hands. The statue is both life-like and larger than life: an embodiment of human accomplishment, of perfection, magnificence and beauty. The David has a life of his own, and this life succeeds in telling us something about ourselves. --Editor's description<br><br>This volume by Coonin (Rhodes College) begins with the famous 1991 attack on Michelangelo's David that set the stage for a modern-day reassessment of this important Renaissance sculpture. The story of the David is a famous one, but Coonin enlivens the narrative by detailing its conception out of the block of marble cut from the quarry of Fantiscritti to its creation, its political implications in the Renaissance, and its critical appraisal throughout history. The discourse surrounding the removal of the sculpture from outside, in the Piazza della Signoria, into the Accademia Gallery in Florence, is a fascinating case study on how a work of art can increase in fame with its relocation, which in this case led to an outpouring of scholarship on the statue and its preservation. Coonin s narrative also shows how a work of art becomes famous and how that fame shapes and changes the understanding of, and interest in, such a work of art. This brings readers back to a better understanding of the 1991 act of vandalism that further confirms how highly fetishized Michelangelo s David has become. Summing Up:Recommended.

Shubaly swore to avenge the wrongs against his mother, but instead plunged into a magnificently toxic love affair with alcohol.<br><br>Almost two decades later, Shubaly's life changed again when a fateful five-mile run after a bar fight inspired him to clean up his life.

This enthralling classic of Spiritualism, first published in 1924, is now available again to enlighten and inspire. --- from book&#39;s back cover</p><p>Dr. Carl A. Wickland, (1861-1945) was a member of the Chicago Medical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the chief psychiatrist at the National Psychopathic Institute of Chicago. Wickland specialized in cases of schizophrenia, paranoia, depression, addiction, manic-depression, criminal behavior and other phobias. After moving to Los Angeles in 1918, he founded the National Psychological Institute of Los Angeles with his wife Anna Wickland, who was a trance medium. Wickland treated many patients suffering from mental illness of all kinds, and after many years experience came to the conclusion that a number of patients he treated had &#39;attachments;&#39; by that he meant that spiritual entities had attached themselves to unwitting mortals and influenced them (often) in the worst kind of way - leading them to alcoholism, madness, and occasionally murder. Wickland stated at the time; Spirit obsession is a fact - a perversion of a natural law - and is amply demonstrable. This has been proven hundreds of times by causing the supposed insanity or aberration to be temporarily transferred from the victim to a psychic sensitive who is trained for the purpose, and by this method ascertain the cause of the psychosis to be an ignorant or mischievous spirit, whose identity may frequently be verified. Having come to the &#39;spirit obsession&#39; conclusion, Wickland and his wife set up a rescue circle, with Mrs. Wickland acting as the medium, and they set about communicating with lost souls who had passed away and were unaware of their post physical death condition and often in denial due to dogmatic religious and equally dogmatic atheist beliefs.</p><h2>The Country of the Pointed Firs and Other Stories (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>The masterpiece&nbsp;that established Sarah Orne Jewett among the consummate stylists of nineteenth-century American fiction</b><p>Composed in a series of beautiful web-like sketches, the novel is narrated by a young woman writer who leaves the city to work one summer in the Maine seaport of Dunnet Landing, and stays with the herbalist Mrs. Almira Todd.

Hughes uniquely traces the development of Islam in relation to historical, intellectual, and cultural influences, enriching his narrative with the findings, debates, and methodologies of related disciplines, such as archaeology, history, and Near Eastern studies. Hughes's work challenges the dominance of traditional terms and concepts in religious studies, recasting religion as a set of social and cultural facts imagined, manipulated, and contested by various actors and groups over time. Making extensive use of contemporary identity theory, Hughes rethinks the teaching of Islam and religions in general and helps facilitate a more critical approach to Muslim sources. For readers seeking a non-theological, unbiased, and richly human portrait of Islam, as well as a strong grasp of Islamic study's major issues and debates, this textbook is a productive, progressive alternative to more classic surveys.</p><p>Aaron W.

Tolkien's definitive three-book epic, the Lord of the Rings (encompassing <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>, <i>The Two Towers</i>, and <i>The Return of the King</i>), and its charming precursor, <i>The Hobbit</i>. That many (if not most) fantasy works are in some way derivative of Tolkien is understood, but the influence of the Lord of the Rings is so universal that everybody from George Lucas to Led Zeppelin has appropriated it for one purpose or another. <p> Not just revolutionary because it was groundbreaking, the Lord of the Rings is timeless because it's the product of a truly top-shelf mind. Tolkien was a distinguished linguist and Oxford scholar of dead languages, with strong ideas about the importance of myth and story and a deep appreciation of nature. His epic, 10 years in the making, recounts the Great War of the Ring and the closing of Middle-Earth's Third Age, a time when magic begins to fade from the world and men rise to dominance. Tolkien carefully details this transition with tremendous skill and love, creating in the Lord of the Rings a universal and all-embracing tale, a justly celebrated classic. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><b>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien</b>, creator of Middle-Earth and author of <i>The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>The Silmarillion</i> was born in the town of Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State, where his father, Arthur, had moved to take up a senior position with a bank. <br><br>The years after the Great War were devoted to his work as an academic: as Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, where he was soon to prove himself one of the finest philologists in the world. He had already started to write a great cycle of the myths and legends of Middle-Earth which was to become <i>The Silmarillion</i>. He and Edith had four children and it was for them that first told the tale of <i>The Hobbit</i>, published in 1937 by Sir Stanley Unwin. <i>The Hobbit</i> proved to be so successful that Sir Stanley was soon asking for a sequel: but it was not until 1954, when Tolkien was approaching retirement, that he the first volume of his great masterpiece, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, was published, and its terrific success took him by surprise.<br><br>After retirement Ronald and Edith moved to Bournemouth but when Edith died in 1971, Ronald returned to Oxford.

In the near future, a large portion of humanity is wiped out by a brutal, new virus that hardens the skin while dissolving internal organs. Those who aren&#39;t immune are either severely crippled or allowed to live with cybernetically enhanced bodies. Taking advantage of a world in chaos, a paramilitary force known as the Propater topples the United Nations and seeks world domination. Elia, a young survivor searching for his mother, travels towards the Andes Mountains with an artificially intelligent combat robot. When he encounters a group of anti-Propater freedom fighters, a maelstrom of unique characters unfolds. Graphic, cyberpunk, and philosophical, Eden is a place where endearing heroes face a constant struggle for survival and violent surprises wait around every corner!</p><p><b>Hiroki Endo</b> is a manga artist best known for the science fiction series <i>Eden: It&#x2019;s an Endless World</i>, which was named best manga by <i>Wizard</i> magazine in 2007. He is also the author of <i>Meltdown</i> and <i>All Rounder Meguru</i> series and a short-story manga collection titled <i>Hiroki Endo&#x2019;s Tanpenshu.</i>A gay man, near death from the paralysis that has killed billions already, and two teenagers--one his best friend's son--live in a huge experimental facility, now dilapidated, that was built to foster plague-resistant individuals. The teens are its only success stories. Now the boy's father, his brain joined to a mechanical body, returns with soldiers and UN personnel. Amid revelations of friendship betrayed, a fight breaks out. With the help of an AI the boy has reanimated, the teens prevail. Twenty years later, the boy's son, accompanied by the same AI, explores a deserted city, and three men and a seeming girl capture him. Endo mutes <i>manga</i> distinctives for realism's sake (e.g., eyes look normal, not the size of saucers), keeps the violence short and sharp, inserts a few low-key satiric jibes at late-twentieth-century sociopolitics, and paces the narrative to facilitate milieu and character development. He conjures a postapocalyptic aura of near-palpable mystery. Why did what happened occur? Fortunately, this is just volume 1. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

And yet it is nearly impossible for us to talk openly and honestly about sex. <i>Talk Dirty to Me is </i>author Sallie Tisdale's frank, funny, and provocative invitation to the conversation we've been waiting for&#x2014;but have been too afraid to start.<br><br>Sallie Tisdale shuns the dry style of academics and takes us on a journey through gender and desire, romance and pornography, prostitution and morality, fantasies and orgasm. She guides us through her field research of peep shows, XXX stores, and even the pornography collection of the British Library. Interweaving her own personal feelings, experiences, and revelations, she presents a brilliant, fascinating, and wholly original portrait of sex and sexuality in America, while encouraging us to explore and create our own "intimate philosophies."</p></p><p>"This book is not about pornography. No writer likes that question--'What's your book about?' It's almost impossible to sum up a book in a few words. In <i>Talk Dirty to Me</i>, I discuss pornography, prostitution, orgasms, fantasies, and other things sexual, but the book is about why<i> </i>these things are significant. The result is a 'philosophy'--an intimate, entirely personal philosophy about the role of sex in human life. I don't expect readers to agree or disagree with my ideas. (In fact, I hope I make most readers blush and complain at least once; that eternal elusiveness of explanation is part of what fascinates me about the subject.) My sexual philosophy is that of a bisexual woman of a certain generation and culture, and it can't encompass or explain much more than that. I consider myself 'sex-positive,' willing to celebrate the Iife-affirming nature of sex and to tolerate with cheer the enormous variations sex takes in human lives. Human beings will endlessly try to understand and explain sex to one another--and to themselves.

One of the first true Main Battle Tanks, it was designed to replace both medium (Centurion) and heavy (Conqueror) tanks in front line service and provided the backbone of the British Army's heavy armour at the height of the Cold War. It incorporated a lot of revolutionary design features, although some did not work as well as expected. For example, in order to reduce height the driver lay in a reclining position and changed gear with his foot. The L11 120mm gun used a self-combusting bagged charge instead of a brass cartridge case (the gun proved to be highly successful); and the tank was powered by a multi-fuel engine. The Chieftain was continually upgraded during its service life: later marks were fitted with a laser rangefinder; a computerised fire-control system (IFCS), thermal sights (TOGS) and additional compound armour on the front of the turret and around the driver's hatch (so-called Stillbrew armour). The L60 engine was continually modified and improved to increase its output and reliability. The end result of all these changes was a formidable AFV. The Chieftain hull was also used for a range of specialised AFVs, including armoured recovery vehicles (ARV and ARRV), bridge layers (AVLB) and combat engineering tanks (AVRE). A total of more than 2,200 Chieftains of all types were manufactured by the Royal Ordnance Factories and Vickers Ltd. Some 900 of these served with the British Army while the remaining 1,300 tanks were exported to Iran, Jordan, Kuwait and the Oman. Chieftains saw their share of combat with the Iranian Army in the 1980s when they engaged Iraqi tanks during the Iran-Iraq War, while Kuwaiti Chieftains fought the Iraqi Army during the invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Chieftain gun tanks were withdrawn from front-line service with the British Army during the late 1980s and early 1990s, but Chieftain recovery and combat engineering vehicles served with the British Army during the operations to liberate Kuwait in 1991 (Desert Storm).</p></p><p><p><b>Dick Taylor</b> is a former British Army Challenger tank commander and now works fulltime as an author specialising in armoured fighting vehicles.

As well as being a multi-award winning author, Wagner was a highly successful editor and publisher of horror, science fiction and heroic fantasy, creating a definitive three-volume set of Robert E.

Ron Hubbard as the <i>Book One of Scientology. </i>After having fully unified and codified the subjects of Dianetics and Scientology came the refinement of their <i>fundamentals. </i><br></p> <p>Originally published as a r�sum� of Scientology for use in translations into non-English tongues, this book is of inestimable value to both the beginner and advanced student of the mind, spirit and life. Equipped with this book alone, one can begin a practice and perform seeming miracle changes in the states of well-being, ability and intelligence of people.<br></p> <p>Contained within are the <i>Conditions of Existence, Eight Dynamics, ARC Triangle, Parts of Man, </i>the full analysis of <i>Life as a Game, </i>and more, including exact processes for individual application of these principles in processing. Here, then, in one book, is the starting point for bringing Scientology to people everywhere.</p></p><p><p>L. Ron Hubbard</p><p>There are only two tests of a life well lived L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard once remarked: Did one do as one intended? And were people glad one lived? In testament to the first stands the full body of his life&#x2019;s work, including some 12,000 writings and 3,000 tape-recorded lectures of Dianetics and Scientology.&nbsp; &nbsp;In evidence of the second are the hundreds of millions of individuals whose lives have been demonstrably bettered because he lived. They are the more than 28 million students now reading superlatively owing to L. Ron Hubbard&#x2019;s educational discoveries; they are the millions of men and women freed from substance abuse through L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard&#x2019;s breakthroughs in drug rehabilitation; they are the near 100 million who have been touched by his nonreligious moral code: and they are the many millions more who hold his work to be the spiritual cornerstone of their lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Although best known for Dianetics and Scientology, L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard cannot be so simply categorized. If nothing else, his life was too varied, his influence too broad. There are tribesmen in Southern Africa, for example, who know nothing of Dianetics and Scientology, but they know L. Ron Hubbard the educator.&nbsp; Likewise, there are factory workers in Albania who know him only for his administrative discoveries; children in China who know him only as the author of their moral code, and readers in dozens of languages who know him only for his novels. So, no, L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard is not an easy man to categorize and certainly does not fit popular misconceptions of &#x201c;religious founder&#x201d; as an aloof and contemplative figure. Yet the more one comes to know this man and his achievements, the more one comes to realize he was precisely the sort of person to have brought us Scientology, the only major religion to have been founded in the twentieth century.&nbsp;</p><p>What Scientology offers is likewise what one would expect of a man such as&nbsp; L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard. For not only does it provide a fully unique approach to our most fundamental questions&#x2014;Who are we? From where did we come and what is our destiny? But it further provides an equally unique technology for greater spiritual awareness. So how would we expect to characterize the founder of such a religion? Clearly, he would have to be larger than life, attracted to people, liked by people, dynamic, charismatic and immensely capable in a dozen fields&#x2014;all exactly L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact is, if Mr. Hubbard had stopped after only one of his many accomplishments he would still be celebrated today. For example, with 46 million works of fiction in circulation, including such monumental bestsellers as Battlefield Earth, Fear and the Mission Earth series, Mr. Hubbard is unquestionably one of the most acclaimed and widely read authors of all time. His novels have earned some of the world&#x2019;s most prestigious literary awards, and he has very genuinely been described as &#x201c;one of the most prolific and influential writers of the twentieth century.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>His earlier accomplishments are similarly impressive. As a barnstorming aviator through the 1930s he was known as &#x201c;Flash&#x201d; and broke local records for sustained glider flight. As a leader of expeditions, he is credited with conducting the first complete Puerto Rican mineralogical survey under United States protectorship and his navigational annotations still influence the maritime guides for British Columbia. His experimentation with early radio direction finding further became the basis for the Long Range Navigational system (Loran). And, as a lifelong photographer, his works have been displayed in galleries on two continents, with the definitive body of his photographs in traveling and permanent exhibits still drawing tens of thousands every year.&nbsp;</p><p>Among other avenues of research, Mr. Hubbard developed and codified an administrative technology that is utilized by more than 200,000 organizations worldwide, including multinational corporations, charitable bodies, political parties, schools, youth clubs and every imaginable small business. Likewise Mr. Hubbard&#x2019;s internationally acclaimed educational methods are utilized by more than a hundred thousand educators, while his equally acclaimed drug rehabilitation program has proven at least five times more effective than similarly aimed programs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet, however impressive these figures, no measure of L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard is complete without some appreciation of what became his life&#x2019;s work: Dianetics and Scientology.&nbsp; The world&#x2019;s most effective force for positive change, the Church of Scientology represents spiritual freedom for millions of people the world over. They come from every walk of life, every culture and every strata of society. Moreover, when one is speaking of L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard&#x2019;s discoveries relating to the human mind and spirit, one is ultimately speaking of the philosophic foundation of all he accomplished: better education, crime-free cities, drug-free campuses, stable and ethical organizations and cultural revitalization through the arts&#x2014;all this and more is made possible because of the breakthroughs in Dianetics and Scientology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Democracy Is in the Streets: From Port Huron to the Siege of Chicago, With a New Preface by the Author</h2><p>On June 12, 1962, sixty young student activists drafted a manifesto for their generation&#x2015;<i>The Port Huron Statement</i>&#x2015;that ignited a decade of dissent. <i>Democracy Is in the Streets</i> is the definitive history of the major people and ideas that shaped the New Left in America during that turbulent decade. Because the 1960s generation is now moving into positions of power in politics, education, the media, and business, their early history is crucial to our understanding. James Miller, in his new Preface, puts the 1960s and them into a context for our time, claiming that something of value did happen: &#x201c;Most of the large questions raised by that moment of chaotic openness&#x2015;political questions about the limits of freedom, and cultural questions, too, about the authority of the past and the anarchy of the new&#x2015;are with us still.&#x201d;</p><p>James Miller, Professor of Political Science and Director of Liberal Studies at the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research, is the author of The Passion of Michel Foucault and Rousseau: Dreamer of Democracy.In 1962, at Port Huron, Mich., Tom Hayden led members of Students for a Democratic Society in drafting a manifesto advocating participatory democracy. "The Port Huron Statement" became a beacon to student activists and civil rights workers during the 1960s. Miller, an ex-SDS member and author of Rousseau: Dreamer of Democracy, argues here that the Port Huron proclamation owes as much to Quaker practices, John Dewey's pragmatism and civic republican philosophy as it does to Karl Marx. In charting the history of the New Left through the lives of a handful of SDS leaders, this highly personal chronicle sometimes lacks balance and loses sight of the broader political context. The participatory spirit of Port Huron lives on, maintains Miller, in current efforts to democratize all areas of life, from the workplace to the family.

As a fixture on television and a bestselling author, Sagan became instantly recognizable. To people around the world, he offered entr�e into the mysteries of the cosmos and of science in general. To much of the scientific community, though, he was something of a pariah, a brazen publicity seeker who cared more about his image and his fortune than the advancement of science. Poundstone reveals the seldom-discussed aspects of Sagan's life, the legitimate and important work of his early scientific career, the almost obsessive capacity to take on less projects, the multiple marriages and fractured tumultuous personal life-all essential elements of this complicated and extraordinary man, truly the first and most famous scientist of the media age.<br></p><p>Science writer William Poundstone (and biographer of game-theory guru <i>John von Neumann</i>) begins this book of deftly strung anecdotes from the life of pop-science demigod Carl Sagan with the following anecdote: four-year-old Carl, a Jewish kid growing up near the Jersey shore, rides piggyback on his dad's shoulders into the 1939 World's Fair and the "World of Tomorrow." Surrounded by mocked-up "rocketports," GM's "Futurama," and the promise of outlandish technology to come, it's easy to imagine the impact on this little guy who was to become one of our century's most visionary and visible scientists. A childhood friend tells Poundstone that "from an early age Carl was seized with the fabulous mission of searching for life on other worlds," a quest that would dominate his entire professional career.<p> Poundstone recounts how this quest drove the immensely intelligent, ambitious, and charismatic Sagan, from his discovery of Arthur C. Clarke to his predictable adolescent chemistry-set accidents to his colorful academic career and professional work on the <i>Viking</i> and <i>Voyager</i> missions, nuclear disarmament, the award-winning <i>Cosmos</i>, and Robert Zemeckis' <i>Contact</i>. What recommends this biography most, though, isn't its completeness but its style: Poundstone has divided the 500-plus-page book into over 200 easily digestible, addictive little sections, each an entertaining or illuminating (or, often, laugh-out-loud) anecdote from Sagan's life, with titles like "Pornography in Space," "Muskrats, Drunkards, Extraterrestrials," and "Sagan Versus Apple Computer." (The in-house name for the mid-range PowerMac 7100 was "Carl Sagan," the joke being that it would make Apple "billions and billions." But forced to change it by Sagan, Apple switched to "BHA," later revealed to stand for "Butt-Head Astronomer"--Sagan sued for libel.) <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>William Poundstone has been twice nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Among his seven books are The Recursive Universe, Labyrinths of Reason, and Big Secrets. He has also written extensively for network television and major magazines. He lives in Los Angeles.<br></p><h2>Transbluesency: The Selected Poetry of Amiri Baraka/LeRoi Jones (1961-1995)</h2><p>The first collection of selected poetry from perhaps the preeminent African American literary figure of our time. Baraka almost single-handedly changed both the nature and the form of post-World War II African-American literature, and this volume is an important contribution to Modernist literature.</p><p>The poems selected here span from Baraka's first collection, Preface to a Twenty Volume Suicide Note (1961), to the long poem Wise, Why's, Y'z, published earlier this year. The best work here has been culled from his second and third books, The Dead Lecturer (1964) and Black Magic (1969). Despite coming out of distinct phases in Baraka's life (the former when he was a book Beat, by the latter he'd become black nationalist), these works combine the personal and political in highly charged ways. When Baraka writes of "the roaring harmonies of need" or of "stumbling over our souls in the dark, for the sake of unnatural advantage," he succeeds as both an activist and a poet. However, as revolutionary politics increasingly intrude, Baraka seems largely to abandon the craft of poetry for the the broader strokes of diatribe and rant ("dont tell me shit about the tradition of slavemasters/ &amp; henry james... "). However disappointing much of this later work may be, it is readily argued that Baraka's influential work prefigured rap and the current vogue of spoken-word performances and poetry slams. This collection provides a useful overview of his work. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.As the editor of this critically important collection explains in his foreword, the title Transbluesency derives from a 1946 Duke Ellington composition. The entire book resonates with jazz rhythms and homages to Thelonius Monk, Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins, and John Coltrane. This use of jazz as inspiration and artistic model is just one of many signs that Baraka (formerly LeRoi Jones) came of age during the Beat movement and remains perhaps its truest practitioner. His poems are aggressive challenges to the status-quo, relying on daring images, short chant-like lines, neologisms, slang, blues lyrics, and scat-singing: "BaBa Ree Bopp/Ooo Shoobie/Doobie." Transbluesency is a chronicle of nearly 40 years of poetic output, from "Preface to a Twenty Volume Suicide Note" (1961) to "Wise, Why's, Y's" (1995). In an era when celebrated African American poets like Rita Dove and Yusef Komunyakaa are writing highly literary verse, Baraka raucously celebrates "negritude." Highly recommended.?Daniel L.

Mlodinow had written a groundbreaking Ph.D. thesis, but he was afraid he was simply not smart enough to be at Caltech. In danger of losing himself watching hours of Rockford Files reruns while waiting for one good idea, Mlodinow took his doubts and insecurities to Caltech's intimidating resident genius and iconoclast, Richard Feynman. So began a pivotal year in a young man's life and a year of awakening.<br>In the funny, inspiring, and revelatory book, Leonard Mlodinow looks back at the time he shared with Feynman: the ideas they explored, the views of life and physics they exchanged, and what Mlodinow learned from a mentor who had not only helped shape the landscape of physics, but whose mind was drawn to all aspects of human experience. In a series of fascinating, sprawling exchanges, Feynman delved into the nature of science, creativity, love, mathematics, happiness, God, art, pleasures and ambition. And as the relationship between the older scientist and Mlodinow deepened - at one point the two crashed a wedding buffet together - their conversations took on a sense of urgency. For while Mlodinow was floundering, Feynman was battling cancer - and confronting his own mortality.</p><p>Leonard Mlodinow lives in Pasadena, California.<p>IN A GRAY CEMENT building on the olive tree-lined Caltech campus on California Boulevard in Pasadena, a thin man with longish hair steps into his modest office. Some students, on this planet less than one-third as long as the professor has been, stop in the hallway and stare. No one would say a word if he didn't come to the office this day, but nothing could keep him away, especially not the surgery, the effects of which he would no longer allow to ruin his routine. <br>&nbsp;<br>Outside, bright sun bathes the palm trees, but it is no longer the withering sun of the summer. The hills rise, brown now giving way to green, their vegetation reborn with the coming of the more hospitable winter season. The professor might have wondered how many more cycles of green and brown he would live to witness; he knew he had a disease that would kill him. He loved life, but he believed in natural law, and not in miracles. When his rare form of cancer was first discovered in the summer of 1978, he had searched the literature. Five-year survival rates were generally reported to be less than 10 percent. Virtually no one survived ten years. He was into his fourth. <br>&nbsp;<br>Some forty years earlier, when he was almost as young as the students currently around him, he had sent a series of papers to the prestigious journal Physical Review. The papers contained odd little diagrams, which constituted a new way of thinking about quantum mechanics, less formal than the standard mathematical language of physics. Though few seemed convinced of his new approach, he thought how amusing it would be if some day that journal would be full of his diagrams. As it turned out, the method they reflected proved to be not only correct and useful, but revolutionary, and on that day late in 1981, in the Physical Review, his diagrams were ubiquitous. They were about as famous as diagrams get. And he was about as famous, at least in the world of science, as scientists get. <br>&nbsp;<br>The professor has been working on a new problem the past couple of years. The method he worked out in his student days had been wildly successful when applied to a theory called quantum electrodynamics. That is the theory of the electromagnetic force that governs, among other things, the behavior of the electrons that orbit the nucleus of the atom. These electrons impart to atoms their chemical properties and their spectral properties (the colors of light they emit and absorb). Hence the study of these particular electrons and their behavior is called atomic physics. But since the professor's student days physicists had made great progress in a new field called nuclear physics. Nuclear physics looks beyond the electronic structure of atoms to the potentially much more violent interactions of the protons and neutrons within the nucleus. Though protons are subject to the same electromagnetic force that governs the behavior of the atomic electrons, these interactions are dominated by a new force, a force that is far stronger than the electromagnetic force. It is called, fittingly, the U strong force." <br>&nbsp;<br>To describe the strong force a grand new theory had been invented. The new theory had some mathematical similarities to quantum electrodynamics, and it was given a name that reflected these similarities quantum chromodynamics (despite the root, chromo, it has nothing to do with color as we know it). In principle quantum chromodynamics provided a precise quantitative description of protons, neutrons, and related particles and how they interact--how they might bind to each other, or behave in collisions. But how do we extract descriptions of these processes from the theory? The professor's approach applied in principle to this new theory but practical complications arose. Though quantum chromodynamics had had certain triumphs, for many situations neither the professor nor anyone else knew how to use his diagrams--or any other method--to extract accurate numerical predictions from the theory. Theorists couldn't even calculate the mass of the proton--a very basic quantity that had long ago been accurately measured by the experimentalists. <br>&nbsp;<br>The professor thinks, perhaps, that with the months or years he has left on earth he'll play around with the problem of quantum chromodynamics, considered one of the most important of its day. To create the energy and will he needs for his effort, he tells himself that everyone else who had for so many years unsuccessfully attacked this problem lacked certain qualities that he possesses. What they are he, Richard Feynman, isn't sure: an oddball approach, perhaps. Whatever those qualities are, they had served him well--he had one Nobel Prize, but might arguably have deserved two or three when you considered all the wide-ranging and important breakthroughs he had made in his career. <br>&nbsp;<br>Meanwhile, in 1980, several hundred miles north in Berkeley, a much younger man had sent off a couple papers with his own new approach to solving some of the old mysteries of atomic physics. His method offered answers to some difficult problems, but there was a catch. The world he explored in his imagination was one in which space has an infinite number of dimensions. It is a world with not just up/down, right/left, and forward/backward, but also a countless array of other directions. Could you really say anything useful about our three-dimensional existence by studying a universe like that? And could the method be extended to other areas of study, such as the more modern field of nuclear physics? It would turn out that it is promising enough that this student received a beginning faculty appointment at Caltech, and an office down the hall from Feynman. <br>&nbsp;<br>The night after receiving that offer of employment, I remembered lying in my bed half my life earlier, wondering what it would belike the next day, my first day in junior high. More than anything else, as I recall, I was worried about gym and showering in front of all those other boys. What I was really worried about was ridicule. I would be exposed, too, at Caltech. In Pasadena there would be no faculty advisor, no mentor, just my own answers to the hardest problems the best physicists could think of to me, a physicist who didn't produce brilliant ideas was one of the living dead. At a place like Caltech, he would also be shunned, and soon unemployed. <br>&nbsp;<br>Did I have it or didn't I? Or was I asking the wrong question? I started talking to the thin, dying professor with long hair in an office down the hall. What the old man told me is the subject of this book.</p></p><h2>The Art of Darts</h2><p>Darts has been played&nbsp;around the world&nbsp;for more than 100 years on a competitive basis. Although the sport has gone through many transitional periods during the last century, it has progressed from a pub pastime into one of the largest global sports. Today it is a business of mega-proportions with television coverage reaching almost every part of the globe. Covering every aspect of the game, this is the first user guide for the general market, making it as useful and necessary for the obsessed amateur as for the fledgling professional. From choosing the right grip and constructing out shots to perfecting your stance at the oche, this is an essential purchase for every follower, practitioner, and lover of the beautiful sport of darts.</p><p>John Lowe is a three-time winner of the World Darts championship, and the only player to have won it in three different decades.

"Dancing, he has always been the greatest," even though fellow members of Leningrad's Kirov Ballet, the author observes, called the teenaged Baryshnikovshort, stocky and quick"hockey puck." Few new facts emerge, but it is interesting to note that the dancer's film appearances began in 1971 with his debut in the Soviet-made Fiesta , in which he played a "handsome young matador . . . ready to meet his lonely fate." A "genius he was" at the barre, and although financial and artistic turmoil have rocked the American Ballet Theater periodically since Baryshnikov became artistic director in 1980, "Misha has learned about himself. He admits that he's moody and that when he's down he's intolerable, but he says he's working on it." This remains a celebrity portrait, never bursting the bubble of fame to find the man inside it. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.At age 40 Baryshnikov still has a long career ahead of him as choreographer, artistic director of American Ballet Theater, and actor. This biography of the great ballet dancer can therefore really only tell part of the "story." Two earlier books, Nina Alovert's Baryshnikov in Russia ( LJ 12/84) and Gennady Smakov's Baryshnikov: From Russia to the West ( LJ 4/15/81) have focused just on the dancer's early career.-- Ed.) The book relates important events in Baryshnikov's life--his experiences as a young dancer in Russia, and his dizzying number of U.S. dance and acting projects. Baryshnikov's personal side is presented, too, including his much publicized romantic liaisons and commitment to parenting. While the book has little new information or substantial journalistic reporting, it is, nevertheless, a serviceable and straightforward biography for the YA audience.<br><i>- Joan Stahl, Enoch Pratt Free Lib., Baltimore</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett</h2><p>Providing an in-depth, up-to-date look at Buffett and his company, Berkshire Hathaway, this book clearly shows the fundamental reasons for his exalted achievements. It also takes a look at Berksire&#39;s investments which include 200 million shares of the Coca-Cola Company. This biography will have an appeal to anyone in the business world. 92 photos.</p><p><p>At age six Warren Buffett paid a quarter for a six pack of Cokes and sold each Coke for a nickel-a return of 20%. From then on he compounded his returns at better than 20%. That's why he's a multi-billionaire-indeed the second richest person in the world.. </p><p>Today Buffett's investment vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway, is a major shareholder in some of the greatest companies on earth: Coca-Cola, Gillette, Disney, American Express, a brand name extravaganza. GEICO, Berkshire's auto insurance unit, and Berkshire's other insurance entities, make up one of Buffett's secret weapons. They provide about $7 billion of "float," or other peoples money. Berkshire receives the money in the form of premiums and invests it, multiplying it profitably until time to pay off insurance claims. Berkshire, often thought of as a batch of stocks worth about $40 billion, is far more. The stock portfolio Is one of its three legs. The second leg is the enormous insurance business. A third leg is a collection of wholly owned businesses. With the purchase of the rest of GEICO in early 1996, the buyout of FlightSafety International in late 1996 and the smaller purchases of Star Furniture in 1997 and International Dairy Queen in 1998, Berkshire is now a constellation of operating businesses. The enormous stock portfolio, the insurance businesses and the operating businesses all do one thing-throw off a ton of cash for new investments. None of this counts the 129.7 million ounces of silver, some oil and fixed-income portfolio worth north of $10 billion. And none of this includes Berkshire's newest amazing deal-the $22 billion purchase of General Re Corp. Although it is Buffett's genius and personality which holds Berkshire together, he has had help from an extraordinary group of people. First and foremost is Charles Munger who has offered advice for almost 40 years and has pulled Buffett away from investing in lesser quality stocks. Munger has helped Buffett see the advantages of brand name companies with consumer franchises, pricing power and durability. Buffett and Munger-in Buffett's words-became "mental partners" back in 1959. Munger jokes that he deserves credit for hooking up with Buffett in the early days when Buffett had no outward appearances of success. "He had a crew cut. He was working out of a sun porch at his house and his dietary [leanings] were toward Pepsi, salted nuts and no vegetables." Munger, Lou Simpson and Ajit Jain within Berkshire have aided Buffett as have a number of figures outside Berkshire, including Tom Murphy, Katharine Graham and Bill Ruane.</p>A fascinating journey inside the world--and mind--of Warren Buffett. Warren Buffett is history&#39;s greatest investor--and America&#39;s third-richest man. But how did Buffet reach that pinnacle? What did he see that others missed? And perhaps most important...What does he see today? Of Permanent Value takes us where no other book has, making us privy to Warren Buffett&#39;s successes, his secrets to investing, and his plans for the future. From earning pennies selling Coca-Cola in his youth to buying a major stake in the soft drink giant as an adult, Warren Buffet has always followed his own path. Of Permanent Value offers a uniquely candid overview of that path, including: how Buffett turned a 1956 investment of $10,000 into $250 million today--after taxes!; step-by-step replays of Buffett&#39;s best investment moves--and some he&#39;d just as soon forget; extensive interviews with Buffett&#39;s family, friends, and business associates that reveal his thoughts and investments philosophies. Filled with fascinating facts, rare photographs, and compelling stories from some of the world&#39;s leading public figures--all told in nugget-sized chapters that are fascinating to read and impossible to put down--Of Permanent Value is the story of Warren Buffet himself. It is an intrinsically American tale, one to which we can all relate...and from which we can all profit. So pull up a set and have a few words with the &#34;Oracle of Omaha&#34;--one of the great financial minds of all time.</p><h2>Banco: The Further Adventures of Papillon</h2><p>Here at last is the sensational sequel to &#34;Papillon&#34; - the great story of escape and adventure that took the world by storm. &#34;Banco&#34; continues the adventures of Henri Charriere - nicknamed &#39;Papillon&#39; - in Venezuela, where he has finally won his freedom after thirteen years of escape and imprisonment.

Author John A.

Despite what many believe, Washington did not come to the American Revolution completely unskilled in this area of warfare. Espionage was a skill he honed during the French and Indian war and upon which he heavily depended during the Revolutionary War. He used espionage to level the playing field and then exploited it on to final victory. </p><p>Filled with thrilling and never-before-told stories from the battlefield and behind enemy lines, this is the story of how Washington out-spied the British.

After a decade of sleuthing in the royal archives, Diarmaid MacCulloch has emerged with a tantalizing new understanding of Henry's mercurial chief minister, the inscrutable and utterly compelling Thomas Cromwell.<br><br>History has not been kind to the son of a Putney brewer who became the architect of England's split with Rome. Where past biographies portrayed him as a scheming operator with blood on his hands, Hilary Mantel reimagined him as a far more sympathetic figure buffered by the whims of his master. So which was he--the villain of history or the victim of her creation? MacCulloch sifted through letters and court records for answers and found Cromwell's fingerprints on some of the most transformative decisions of Henry's turbulent reign. But he also found Cromwell the man, an administrative genius, rescuing him from myth and slander. <br><br>The real Cromwell was a deeply loving father who took his biggest risks to secure the future of his son, Gregory. He was also a man of faith and a quiet revolutionary. In the end, he could not appease or control the man whose humors were so violent and unpredictable. But he made his mark on England, setting her on the path to religious awakening and indelibly transforming the system of government of the English-speaking world.</p><p><b>Diarmaid MacCulloch</b> is Professor of the History of the Church at Oxford University.

He lives in Oxford, England.&#x201c;Thomas Cromwell has famously defied his biographers, but no more. Diarmaid MacCulloch&#x2019;s book is subtle, witty and precisely constructed. He has sifted the vast archive to clear away the accumulated error, muddle and propaganda of centuries, allowing us to see this clever and fascinating man better than ever before, and in the mirror of his times.

This is a story that spans two continents, ten decades, and eleven thousand miles. When I was three and a half years old, my family was forced to flee Vietnam in June 1979, a place we had never heard of somewhere in the heartland of America. Several weeks later my family lay half-dead from dehydration in a derelict fishing boat jammed with ninety-three refugees lost in the middle of the South China Sea. We arrived in the United States with nothing but the clothes on our backs and unable to speak a single word of English. Today my family holds twenty-one university degrees. How we got from there to here is quite a story. Where the Wind Leads is the remarkable account of Vinh Chung and his refugee family&#39;s daring escape from communist oppression for the chance of a better life in America. It&#39;s a story of personal sacrifice, redemption, endurance against almost insurmountable odds, and what it truly means to be American. All author royalties from the sale of this book will go to benefit World Vision. Flap Copy: Vinh Chung was born in South Vietnam, just eight months after it fell to the communists in 1975. His family was wealthy, controlling a rice-milling empire worth millions; but within months of the communist takeover, the Chungs lost everything and were reduced to abject poverty. Knowing that their children would have no future under the new government, the Chungs decided to flee the country. In 1979, they joined the legendary &#34;boat people&#34; and sailed into the South China Sea, despite knowing that an estimated two hundred thousand of their countrymen had already perished at the hands of brutal pirates and violent seas. Where the Wind Leads follows Vinh Chung and his family on their desperate journey from pre-war Vietnam, through pirate attacks on a lawless sea, to a miraculous rescue and a new home in the unlikely town of Fort Smith, Arkansas. There Vinh struggled against poverty, discrimination, and a bewildering language barrier-yet still managed to graduate from Harvard Medical School. Where the Wind Leads is Vinh&#39;s tribute to the courage and sacrifice of his parents, a testimony to his family&#39;s faith, and a reminder to people everywhere that the American dream, while still possible, carries with it a greater responsibility.</p><p><p>Vinh Chung graduated Harvard magna cum laude with a BA in biology and attended Harvard Medical School for his MD. Dr. Chung also studied at the University of Sydney as a Fulbright Scholar and completed a masters of pharmaceutical sciences. He completed his dermatology residency at Emory University, where he served as chief resident. He currently serves on World Vision's National Leadership Council. Dr. Chung and his wife Leisle have three children and run a successful private practice.</p></p><h2>Citadel</h2><p>Carcassonne 1942. A spirited and courageous young woman, Sandrine, finds herself drawn into the world of the Resistance in Carcassonne under German Occupation. Her network - codenamed &#39;Citadel&#39; - is made up of ordinary women who risk everything to fight the sinister battles raging in the shadows around them. As the war reaches its violent and bloody conclusion, Sandrine&#39;s fate is tied up with that of three very different men. But who is the real enemy? Who is the real threat? And who is the true guardian of the ancient secrets that for generations have drawn people to the foothills of the Pyrenean mountains?</p><p>Kate Mosse Harlan Coben <p><b></b></p> <b>Harlen Coben interviews Kate Mosse, author of The Citadel</b> <p></p> <p><b>HC:</b> You&#x2019;re known for writing historical adventures set in France, but what I love about your stuff &#x2013; and what we perhaps both have in common &#x2013; is an obsession with the past haunting the present. Why are you drawn to this theme?</p> <p><b> KM:</b> 'Haunting the present', that's absolutely it. The decisions made, the mistakes, the violence of the past cast a long shadow and those affect the way people generations later behave. In the south of France- which was occupied from November 1942 to August 1944- that shadow is still there. In some villages, people still walk past the closest bakery because it's owned by a family who informed on their neighbours during the war. In Carcassonne itself, many of the main streets have been renamed in honour of resistance fighters. I knew that the date of death on each sign was the same - 19th August 1944. I became obsessed with finding out what had happened on that day. Over time, the men who died then have been identified, but on the monuments are written words that haunted me for years and were the inspiration for Citadel: 'And Two Unknown Women'. Even after years of research, I never discovered their names. But I knew I could write a novel about the sort of women they must have been - courageous, exceptional. That determination to honour the sacrifice of those unknown women led to Citadel&#x2019;s protagonist Sandrine and her all-female band of resistance fighters. </p> <p><b>HC:</b> Citadel is your first novel set during World War Two. I know you love suspense so how do you create it when, well, we already know the outcome? </p> <p><b>KM:</b> I do love suspense! Much of my reading for pleasure is crime fiction. I love a puzzle, love the business of pitting myself as a reader against the author's imagination. It's tricky, especially with World War II. But of course in adventure writing, as in crime, it's how you get there that matters. The key ingredients in adventure writing are momentum, jeopardy and emotion. Developing the characters and working out the twists and turns of the story are easily as important as the climax itself. That's what I love about writing, working it all out. </p> <p><b>HC:</b> Here&#x2019;s a research question: What was the most extraordinary story you uncovered? More to the point, what do you do when you run across great research but it won&#x2019;t fit into the story? </p> <p><b>KM:</b> I am a novelist, not a historian, and I hate the idea of 'stealing' someone's real life. I don't want to write a thinly-veiled version of a real person. I&#x2019;d rather use my research and imagination to create convincing characters who might have been. So, this is a roundabout way of answering your question. I wanted to protect the identities of people who were generous enough to share their stories with me, or the stories of their parents and grandparents. For example: the woman who showed me the trap door in the floor of their restaurant where they had sheltered Jewish children before smuggling them across the border to Spain; the son who showed me the bullet holes in the wine vats where Resistance fighters hid; the marks in the ground where the signs for the Jewish internment camps &#x2013; whose existence was denied for years - are still visible. So many incredible, dreadful, stories that would have been wrong to include. But the emotion of those stories is in Citadel and the fears, loves, pride, honour of those people appears, I hope, in some of my characters.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p><b>Harlan Coben is the bestselling author of sixteen previous novels, including the #1 New York Times bestsellers "Long Lost" and "Hold Tight.

As the founder and head of Atlantic Records, Ahmet Ertegun signed and/or recorded many of the greatest musical artists of all time, among them Ruth Brown; Big Joe Turner; Ray Charles; Bobby Darin; Sonny and Cher; Eric Clapton; Buffalo Springfield; Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young; Led Zeppelin; the Rolling Stones; Bette Midler; and Kid Rock. Working alongside his older brother, Nesuhi, one of the preeminent jazz producers of all time, and the legendary Jerry Wexler, who produced great soul artists like Wilson Pickett, Solomon Burke, and Aretha Franklin, Ertegun transformed Atlantic Records from a small independent record label into a hugely profitable multinational corporation. In successive generations, he also served as a mentor to record-business tyros like Phil Spector, David Geffen, and Lyor Cohen. <br><br>Brilliant, cultured, and irreverent, Ertegun was as renowned for his incredible sense of personal style and nonstop A-list social life as his work in the studio. Born into great privilege as the son of a high-ranking Turkish diplomat during the last days of the Ottoman Empire, Ertegun spent his life bringing the black-roots music he loved to the world. <br><br>A larger-than-life figure, always hip, Ertegun lived in the grand manner but was never happier than when he found himself in some down-and-out joint listening to music late at night. Blessed with impeccable taste and brilliant business acumen, he brought rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll into the mainstream while creating the music that became the sound track for the lives of multiple generations. <br><br>With supporting characters like Steve Ross, Henry Kissinger, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Jann Wenner, and a host of others, <i>The Last Sultan </i>is the fascinating story of a man who always lived by his own rules.</p><p>An award-winning journalist, novelist, playwright, screenwriter, and former associate editor of the London bureau of <i>Rolling Stone</i>,<b> Robert Greenfield </b>is the author of ten books of fiction and nonfiction, among them the classic <i>STP: A Journey Through America With the Rolling Stones</i>, and critically acclaimed biographies of Jerry Garcia, Timothy Leary, and Bill Graham.&#x201c;Ahmet Ertegun was a man who loved his music and wanted others to hear what may otherwise have gone unheard. . . .

A steady worker, using primarily sombre low-toned colouring, he met Rubens in 1628, and soon after made a first trip to Italy. The pictures painted there reveal a growing interest in both colour range and in the male nude.<br> <br> Vel�zquez only returned to Italy once again in the late 1640&#x2019;s, where he painted his famous portrait of Pope Innocent X and his only female nude, the "Rokeby Venus". But his greatness lies perhaps in his empathetic studies of such characters as the dwarf playmates of the royal children. The weathering of the skin, rags and mortality, as well as the ageing face of the despondent monarch increasingly preoccupied him in later years. The power, insight and brilliant technique of these paintings were to prove profoundly influential on such later artists as Manet, Delacroix, Picasso and Bacon. &nbsp; <strong>About the Series:</strong><br> Each book in TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Art series features:<ul> <li>a detailed chronological summary of the life and oeuvre of the artist, covering his or her cultural and historical importance</li> <li>a concise biography</li> <li>approximately 100 illustrations with explanatory captions</li> </ul></p><p>Norbert Wolf graduated in art history, linguistics and medieval studies at the universities of Regensburg and Munich, and earned his PhD in 1983.

This collection is divided into two sections: the first features eloquent sketches of the West's history and environment, directing our imagination to the sublime beauty of such places as San Juan and Glen Canyon; the concluding section examines the state of Western literature, of the mythical past versus the diminished present, and analyzes the difficulties facing any contemporary Western writer. <b>The Sound of Mountain Water</b> is both a hymn to the Western landscape, an affirmation of the hope embodied therein, and a careful investigation of the West's cultural and natural legacy.</p><p><b>Wallace Stegner</b> (1909&#x2013;1993) was the author of, among other novels,<i> All the Little Live Things</i> (winner of a Commonwealth Club Gold Medal),&nbsp;<i>Angle of Repose</i> (winner of the Pulitzer Prize), and&nbsp;<i>The Spectator Bird</i> (winner of the National Book Award).

Two years ago, Breslin was having trouble getting his left eyelid to open and close. This was too peculiar to ignore, so Breslin decided to pay a rare visit to his doctor. As it turned out, the eyelid was a matter of nerves. But extensive testing revealed something unrelated and life-threatening: he had an aneurysm in his brain - a thin, ballooned artery wall that could burst and kill him at any moment unless he opted for a risky surgical procedure. Breslin agreed to the surgery and at age sixty-five, grateful for this miracle (what else could you call it?), began taking stock of his remarkable life.</p><p>Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Jimmy Breslin reflects on his life after surviving a brain aneurysm in <b>I Want To Thank My Brain For Remembering Me</b>. From his childhood in Queens, to covering stories on Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and the Beatles, to his family and reverence for Catholicism, to the discovery, by "pure luck," that something was wrong, Breslin recalls the events and people of his past and the meaning they have for him in the present. This is his personal tribute to the magic of medicine and the fragility of all life. As Breslin concludes after the success of his operation, "things turned out pretty well."Breslin's confrontation with his mortality began with double vision in his left eye. He had an MRI, which revealed an aneurysm in his brain. He was referred to Robert Spetzler in Arizona, who is considered the best aneurysm neurosurgeon in the world. Thus begins Breslin's odyssey from New York City to Phoenix, which takes readers on a wonderful whirlwind tour of his life.He starts with his childhood in working-class Queens, where his father "left the arena early," abandoning the family. He became a journalist when he was 16 and unabashedly informs his readers: "I invented the news column form and other papers immediately went out and hired imitators with Irish names." He recalls JFK's assassination; while other reporters hung around the White House waiting for press releases, he interviewed the $3.01-an-hour gravedigger at the President's grave.Breslin insists that New York "is the healthiest city in the world" and shows us the sights and sounds, which here include serial killer Son of Sam; Casey Stengel of the 1962 Mets; Malcolm X's murder in 1965, which he witnessed; Norman Mailer's unsuccessful 1969 mayoral campaign; and subway shooter Bernhard Goetz playing out his fantasies with a gun. Breslin discusses the great loves of his life: his late first wife, Rosemary, his present wife, New York City councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge, and their combined nine children.What is most stunning, however, is his rock-hard Catholicism. "There is no such thing as an ex-Catholic," Breslin admonishes as he continually invokes pre-Vatican II phrases such as "state of Grace," "sins of Omission" and an "examination of conscience." We also see Breslin the Luddite railing against the computers "that took the verve out of the whole newsroom and the charm out of the stories" and Breslin the nostalgist looking back on friends like Fat Thomas, Marvin the Torch and Klein the Lawyer.Breslin's brain operation is a success, and with stream-of-consciousness remembrances, he takes us through the procedure. His memoir is as tough as the streets of New York, and as sensitive as a poet in search of the truth.

Harrington is also the author of Virus (1991), among many others. What starts out as a reasonably slick L.A. police thriller with the murder of a thoroughly believable TV talk show host, is suddenly jarred by the appearance of a long-since-canceled TV police detective, Lt. Columbo. The murder victim is Paul Drury, a typically intense and abrasive small-screen tyrant whose popularity is largely based on his intense interest in the loose ends that keep the Lee Harvey Oswald case unsettled. We know who killed Drury right off. It's his ex-wife Alicia, a good-looking blond still on his program staff. What we don't know is why. Why is answered by Lt. Columbo, who still has the French sedan, battered cigar, and rumpled raincoat that distinguished him from Rock Hudson and Dennis Weaver on Sunday nights years ago and who still closes every investigatory interview with a cute, niggling, little, last-minute question that is always of critical importance. Those cute questions quickly lead him to dispose of the fake alibis and red herrings scattered by Alicia and her wealthy boyfriend and co- conspirator Tim Bell. While Columbo busies himself following a string of clues that take him to Las Vegas and the penthouse suite of an old-line, New York mafia capo, Tim and Alicia fret and stew about the location of the late Paul Drury's safe-deposit box. Columbo, without a bit of trouble, turns up gigabytes of computer evidence that bring him to a conclusion right on schedule. His only real problem seems to be qualifying with his police pistol. The appearance of the intensely familiar character, complete with accurate speech patterns, throws a blanket on the proceedings for all but the most devoted Falk fans.

Powerful TV talk-show host Paul Drury is murdered by his ex-wife and her besotted lover, the show's producer. LAPD's Lt. Columbo gets the case and before long we're involved with TV business hustlers, Vegas mobsters, rich right-wing crazies, colorful supporting players and secrets involving sex, gambling and JFK's assassination. At the center, as slyly polite as ever, is the rumpled detective, with his raincoat and cigars, the old jalopy he loves, the offstage wife and family--and of course, the trademark phrase: "just one little thing. . . . " Even though the murderous ex-wife warns her accomplices that Columbo is "not as dumb as he looks. Not as dumb as he acts," they don't believe her until it's too late. Harrington ( For the Defense ) gets every note right and readers will find the action, including the assassination scenes, as vivid as anything on the tube--and without commercials. Readers will clamor for sequels. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Abstract Climates: Helen Frankenthaler in Provincetown</h2><p>An influential abstract expressionist and a pioneer in the Color Field movement, Helen Frankenthaler (1928&#x2013;2011) spent several summers painting in Provincetown, Massachusetts. She first came in 1950 to the seaside town with a long history as an artist colony to study at Hans Hofmann&#x2019;s studio school and would return for more than a decade while married to the artist Robert Motherwell. This finely illustrated publication explores the works from this formative time in Frankenthaler&#x2019;s career, while also examining the artist&#x2019;s innovative methods and process. Drawing inspiration from the natural scenery of Provincetown,&nbsp;Frankenthaler created paintings that reverberate with a suggestiveness of place that goes beyond the idea of landscape to capture the atmosphere and climate of the New England locale. This illuminating look into Frankenthaler&#x2019;s development as an artist reveals how one particular location helped shape an abstract painter whose works never fit neatly within any category of subsequent abstraction.</p><p>A finely illustrated publication that explores the works painted by Helen Frankenthaler in Provincetown, Massachusetts, revealing how the location impacted her development as an influential abstract painter of her time.<br> &nbsp;<b>Lise Motherwell </b>is the daughter of Robert Motherwell and step-daughter of Helen Frankenthaler.<b> Elizabeth A.

Now, in this illuminating biography, Philip L. Fradkin goes beyond Stegner&#x2019;s iconic literary status to give us, as well, the influential teacher and visionary conservationist, the man for whom the preservation and integrity of place was as important as his ability to render its qualities and character in his brilliantly crafted fiction and nonfiction.<br><br>From his birth in 1909 until his death in 1993, Stegner witnessed nearly a century of change in the land that he loved and fought so hard to preserve. We learn of his hardscrabble youth on the Canadian frontier and in Utah, and of his painful relationship with his father, a bootlegger and gambler. We follow his intellectual awakening as a young man and his years as a Depression-era graduate student at the University of Iowa, during its earliest days as a literary center. <br><br>We watch as he finds his home, with his wife, Mary, in the foothills above Palo Alto, which provided him with a long-awaited sense of belonging and a refuge in which he would write his most treasured works. And here are his years as the legendary founder of the Stanford Creative Writing Program, where his students included Ken Kesey, Edward Abbey, Robert Stone, and Wendell Berry.<br><br>But the changes wrought by developers and industrialists were too much for Stegner, and he tirelessly fought the transformation of his Garden of Eden into Silicon Valley. His writings on the importance of establishing national parks and wilderness areas&#x2014;not only for the preservation of untouched landscape but also for the enrichment of the human spirit&#x2014;played a key role in the passage of historic legislation and comprise some of the most beautiful words ever written about the natural world.<br><br>Here, too, is the story&#x2014;told in full for the first time&#x2014;of the accusations of plagiarism that followed the publication of <i>Angle of Repose,</i> and of the shadow they have cast on his greatest work.<br><br>Rich in personal and literary detail, and in the sensual description of the country that shaped his work and his life&#x2014;this is the definitive account of one of the most acclaimed and admired writers, teachers, and conservationists of our time.</p><p>&#x201c;Respectful of his subject but never worshipful, Fradkin has given us our first full critical portrait of the man and his protean career..&#x201d;&#x2015;Hampton Sides, author of <i>Blood and Thunder: An Epic of the American West</i>Philip L.

It ends in 2008 with Hillary Clinton's historic presidential campaign. This was a time of cataclysmic change, when, after four hundred years, expectations about the lives of American women were smashed in just a generation.<br><br>A comprehensive mix of oral history and Gail Collins's keen research--covering politics, fashion, popular culture, economics, sex, families, and work--<i>When Everything Changed</i> is the definitive book on five crucial decades of progress. The enormous strides made since 1960 include the advent of the birth control pill, the end of "Help Wanted--Male" and "Help Wanted--Female" ads, and the lifting of quotas for women in admission to medical and law schools. Gail Collins describes what has happened in every realm of women's lives, partly through the testimonies of both those who made history and those who simply made their way.<br><br>Picking up where her highly lauded book <i>America's Women</i> left off, <i>When Everything Changed</i> is a dynamic story, told with the down-to-earth, amusing, and agenda-free tone for which this beloved <i>New York Times </i>columnist is known. Older readers, men and women alike, will be startled as they are reminded of what their lives once were--"Father Knows Best" and "My Little Margie" on TV; daily weigh-ins for stewardesses; few female professors; no women in the Boston marathon, in combat zones, or in the police department. Younger readers will see their history in a rich new way. It has been an era packed with drama and dreams--some dashed and others realized beyond anyone's imagining.</p><p>Gail Collins was the Editorial Page Editor for the<i> New York Times </i>from 2001-2007--the first woman to have held that position. She currently writes a column for the <em>Time's</em> Op-Ed page twice weekly."Gail Collins's <i>When Everything Changed </i>points out what the women on "Mad Men" know: that period in our history was less enjoyable for the ladies.... The early pages of Ms. Collins's book are peppered with accounts of incidents so outrageous they almost seem like jokes....but Ms. Collins underlines the serious consequences of such risible moments by including the stories of individual women-from overworked housewives to marginalized politicians-whose lives were cramped and deformed by the culture's low opinion of their capabilities.... Ms. Collins reminds us of how many aspects of our lives were affected by the battles these women fought. And even readers who lived through this era may be surprised to discover how much they never knew, or have forgotten...Among the impressive features of Ms. Collins's book is her genial, fair-minded sympathy, her refusal to smirk at the excesses of the most radical '70s feminists or at the stance of women, among them Phyllis Schlafly, who counseled their sisters to stay home where they belonged. This evenhandedness seems all the more admirable later in the book, when she considers the significance of Hillary Rodham Clinton's and Sarah Palin's roles in the 2008 presidential election."&#x2015;<b>Francine Prose</b>, <b><i><em>New York Times</em></i></b><br><br>"<i>Did feminism fail? </i> Gail Collins's smart, thorough, often droll and extremely readable account of women's recent history in America not only answers this question brilliantly, but also poses new ones about the past and the present. . . . Collins . . .begins <i>When Everything Changed</i> with the best summary of American women's social and political history that I've read. . . .One of the many pleasures {here} is that Collins also reminds us of what women did in private."&#x2015;<b>Amy Bloom</b>, <b><i><em>The New York Times Book Review </em></i></b><br><br>"What better time to look at American women's progress since the '60s, now that the dust has settled on the 2008 presidential election when so much was won (and lost) by women?... Gail Collins's near epic history <i>When Everything Changed</i>...also captures the playfulness and humor in women's advancement."&#x2015;<b>Elizabeth Toohey</b>, <b><i><em>The Christian Science Monitor</em></i></b><br><br>"'The past is a foreign country' is the kind of hallowed quotation that's resolutely opaque until you stumble on something that drives home its emotional truth. The uncanny feeling it references is that one that recurs frequently as you read <i>When Everything Changed</i>, the absorbing history of feminism and American women's lives by Gail Collins, the resident editorial fount of wry Midwestern common sense at <i>The New York Times</i>.... What Collins does, which so pitiably few pop-history writers do, is <i>bring the stories</i>, the anecdotes that come to life and pull you in."&#x2015;<b>Ben Dickinson</b>, <b><i><em>Elle</em></i></b><br><br>"This is not only a fascinating record of how far women have come, it is also a missive to a new generation of women, reminding them to keep the faith."&#x2015;<b>Katherine Boyle</b>, <b><i><em>Booklist</em></i></b><br><br>"Fascinating...This story of how ideas that were once the norm began to seem unfair and then absurd is what Gail Collins tells in her lively new book. Until now, the second wave women's movement hasn't had its big ambitious history-the equivalent to Taylor Branch's multivolume narrative of the civil rights movement. There have been brilliant memoirs and revealing biographies and scholarly books that took slices of the movement and put them under a magnifying glass, but nothing as sweeping and accessible as this."&#x2015;<b>Margaret Talbot</b>, <b><i><em>Slate.com'</em>s "Double<em> </em>X"</i></b><br><br>"A lively account...Collins uses her great sense of revealing anecdote, engaging personalities, representative case histories, resonant stories, and startling details to defamiliarize a decade we thought we remembered, and to show how truly far American women have come in every aspect of their lives.... Collins's message is inspiring and timely, and all the techniques she employs to make this book fun to read--and impossible to deny--deserve critical praise as well as popular success."&#x2015;<b>Elaine Showalter</b>, <b><i><em>Progressive Book Club</em></i></b><br><br>"Provides a sweeping, fascinating look at modern women in our country.... It may be a history book, but <i>When Everything Changed</i> reads like a page-turning saga, a race through the years to learn how we got here."&#x2015;<b>Eliza Born�</b>, <b><i><em>BookPage.com</em></i></b><br><br>"I should mention that Collins is at the top of my guest list for my imaginary dinner party, the theme of which would be: 'Famous fun people I'd like to meet and talk with, but probably never will'...Readers will appreciate the exceptional detail with which Collins lays out the accepted universe of closed opportunities and limited horizons that women faced in 1960. Collins interviewed a variety of women from around the country, and it is fascinating to hear them describe a world that seems unthinkable now but which few could imagine challenging at the time....The stories that emerge are...deeply moving."&#x2015;<b>Sharon Ullman</b>, <b><i><em>Boston Sunday Globe</em></i></b><br><br>"Splendid...Collins is a masterful storyteller."&#x2015;<b>Glenn C. Altschuler</b>, <b><i><em>NPR.com</em></i></b></p><h2>Fools of Fortune</h2><p>Irishman William Quinton falls in love and has a brief love affair with his beautiful English cousin, in a story of love, revenge, and violence set against the turbulent relationship between England and Ireland.</p><p>William Trevor was born in County Cork in 1928 and spent his childhood in various provincial Irish towns. He went to Trinity College, Dublin and then to England in 1953. He now lives in Devon. In 1977 William Trevor received an honorary CBE in recognition of his services to literature, and in 1998 he was awarded the prestigious David Cohen British Literature Prize for a lifetime&#39;s achievement in writing.Crowley does a skillful job navigating the variety of English and Irish accents of different classes in this tragedy. Furthermore, the wistfulness that infuses Crowley&#39;s reading is so in keeping with Trevor&#39;s work. There are elements of comedy and whimsy here, but this novel is mostly about how hatred and revenge during the &#34;Irish troubles&#34; consume possibilities for happiness and familial satisfaction. The imperatives of that conflict all but appropriate the novel&#39;s gentle, young hero, Willy Quinton, giving him only a glimpse of the contentment that should have been his. It&#39;s an understated novel and reading, which is indelible, as well. M.O.

His novel <em>Union Dues </em>(1978) was nominated for the National Book Award and the National Critics' Circle Award. He has written over a hundred screenplays and was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He has directed 18 feature films, with another, <em>I Passed This Way</em>, currently in progress. His films <em>Matewan </em>and <em>Lone Star</em>, as well as his previous novel <em>A Moment in the Sun</em>, are often used for instruction in History and American Studies courses. <em>Yellow Earth </em>is his fifth novel.</p><p>Filmmaker Sayles ... is also a highly imaginative short story writer with a sure ear for dialogue, a keen eye for group dynamics, a flair for quickly establishing intriguing mise-en-sc�nes, and the ability to animate a great spectrum of flinty characters ...

By raising much of the funding for his films himself, Sayles functions more independently than most directors, and he has used his freedom to write and produce films with a distinctive personal style and often clearly expressed political positions.From The Return of the Secaucus Seven to Sunshine State, his films have consistently expressed progressive political positions on issues including race, gender, sexuality, class, and disability.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2015;<strong>University of Illinois Press</strong></p><p>Sayles is a terrific writer. His breathtaking precision and attention to detail can make E.L. Doctorow's historical novels look puny and slapdash by comparison.

The whole purpose of <i>k&#x14d;an</i> (<i>gong&#x2019;an</i>, in Chinese) practice is to keep us from missing these myriad opportunities by leading us to certain gates that have traditionally been effective for people to access that marvelous awakening. The forty-eight k&#x14d;ans of the <i>Gateless Barrier</i> (Chinese: <i>Wumenguan</i>; Japanese: <i>Mumonkan</i>) have been waking people up for well over eight hundred years. Chan teacher Guo Gu provides here a fresh translation of the classic text, along with the first English commentary by a teacher of the Chinese tradition from which it originated. He shows that the k&#x14d;ans in this text are not mere stories from a distant past, but are rather pointers to the places in our lives where we get stuck&#x2014;and that each sticking point, when examined, can become a gateless barrier through which we can enter into profound wisdom.</p><p>GUO GU (Dr. Jimmy Yu) is one of the late Master Sheng Yen's senior and closest disciples. He assisted Master Sheng Yen (1930-2009) in leading intensive retreats throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia. Guo Gu also edited and translated a number of Master Sheng Yen's books from Chinese to English. Guo Gu first learned meditation at the age of four from Master Guangqin (1892-1986), one of the most respected Taiwanese meditation masters. In 1982, Guo Gu began meditation practice with Master Sheng Yen, and was eventually ordained a monk. He became Sheng Yen's first personal attendant and translator, traveling worldwide with him. In 1995, he received inka (the seal of approval) for his first Chan experience, and was given permission by Master Sheng Yen to teach Chan independently. In 2000, Guo Gu left monasticism and re-entered lay life. He received his PhD in Buddhist Studies from Princeton University and is now teaching Buddhism and East Asian religions academically as an assistant professor at Florida State University, Tallahassee. He founded the Tallahassee Chan Group (www.tallahasseechan.com) and is also the guiding teacher for the Western Dharma Teachers Training course at the Chan Meditation Center in New York and the Dharma Drum Lineage. He is the author of the eBook single<i> The Essence of Chan</i>."A must-read book on a classic text. Zen is originally a Chinese tradition, and Guo Gu brings the ancient spirit of the old masters alive right now. There is an expansiveness, ease, and practicality that makes the ancient text encouraging, and it&#x2019;s imaginative and hip too. A pleasure to read. "&#x2014;John Tarrant, author of <i>Bring Me the Rhinoceros<br></i><br>"Many translations of these ancient and profound teachings from a Japanese Zen perspective already exist. Why another one? We are fortunate to have this first Chan translation directly from the Chinese. In addition, Guo Gu&#x2019;s beautifully written commentary includes insights from long ago that are of immense help as we reflect on how we actually live today. An invaluable guide for all meditators. "&#x2014;Larry Rosenberg, author of <i>Three Steps to Awakening<br></i><br>"A very helpful guide to the investigation of the Zen k&#x14d;an from a perspective not yet widely known in the West. Guo Gu is a worthy heir to the great Chan master Sheng Yen. He provides lucid comments on each of the cases in the classic k&#x14d;an collection the <i>Gateless Gate,</i> inviting us into our own intimate encounter with Zen&#x2019;s ancestors and our own personal experience of the great matter of life and death. Anyone interested in understanding what a k&#x14d;an really is, how it can be used, and how it uses us, will be informed and enriched by this book. I highly recommend it. "&#x2014;James Ishmael Ford, author of <i>If You&#x2019;re Lucky, Your Heart Will Break: Field Notes from a Zen Life<br></i><br>"Guo Gu&#x2019;s translation of <i>The Gateless Barrier</i> and his commentary reveal a fresh, eminently practical approach to the famous text. Reminding again and again that it is the reader&#x2019;s own spiritual affairs to which each k&#x14d;an points, Guo Gu writes with both broad erudition and the profound insight of a Chan practitioner. In this way, he reveals himself to be a worthy inheritor of his late Master Sheng Yen&#x2019;s teachings. Zen students, called upon to give life to these k&#x14d;ans within their own practice, will find <i>Passing Through the Gateless Barrier</i> a precious resource.

In 1928 he and his family moved to New Mexico, where his heart and mind were soon captured by the Southwest. The Sea of Grass and The Trees were awarded the gold medal of the Societies of Libraries of New York University in 1942.Novel by Conrad Richter, published in 1936, presenting in epic scope the conflicts in the settling of the American Southwest. Set in New Mexico in the late 19th century, the novel concerns the often violent clashes between the pioneering ranchers, whose cattle range freely through the vast sea of grass, and the farmers, or "nesters," who build fences and turn the sod. Against this background is set the triangle of rancher Colonel Jim Brewton, his unstable Eastern wife Lutie, and the ambitious Brice Chamberlain. Richter casts the story in Homeric terms, with the children caught up in the conflicts of their parents. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>Modern Farmhouse Style: 250+ Ways to Harmonize Rustic Charm with Contemporary Living</h2><p>Move over, shabby chic: The new farmhouse look is all about clean lines and modern shapes, paired with rustic textures and clever upcycled decor ideas from the country life.

It also has the merit of treating its subject in a manner that is scholarly and at the same time respects both the greatness of its subject and the limitations of his accessibility. I found it informative, thought-provoking, and a great joy to read.<br><br>&#x201c;The author combines the best features of traditional and modern scholarly techniques. He exposes and highlights the special character of his subject and makes it available for further consideration from a wide variety of standpoints, and contributes to the current scholarly discussion about the relevance and adequacy of the concepts of &#x2018;saint&#x2019; for cross-cultural studies and for contemporary constructive work in the areas of ethics, religious studies, and post-modern philosophy.<br><br>&#x201c;Sai Baba is exemplary among the great saints of Maharashtra in western India for the ways in which he drew upon and surpassed the categories, concepts, and styles of a variety of conventionally competing religious traditions. Maharashtra is well-known for the integrative spirituality of its foremost figures, and among them Sai Baba of Shirdi is particularly important. The author &#x2018;locates&#x2019; Sai Baba in the contexts of both Islamic and Hindu traditions.&#x201d; &#x2015; Gene R.

At first glance, the Union&#x2019;s plan seemed brilliant: A regiment of miners would burrow beneath a Confederate fort, pack the tunnel with explosives, and blow a hole in the enemy lines. Then a specially trained division of African American infantry would spearhead a powerful assault to exploit the breach created by the explosion. Thus, in one decisive action, the Union would marshal its mastery of technology and resources, as well as demonstrate the superior morale generated by the Army of the Potomac&#x2019;s embrace of emancipation. At stake was the chance to drive General Robert E. Lee&#x2019;s Army of North Virginia away from the defense of the Confederate capital of Richmond&#x2013;and end the war. <br><br>The result was something far different. The attack was hamstrung by incompetent leadership and political infighting in the Union command. The massive explosion ripped open an immense crater, which became a death trap for troops that tried to pass through it. Thousands of soldiers on both sides lost their lives in savage trench warfare that prefigured the brutal combat of World War I. But the fighting here was intensified by racial hatred, with cries on both sides of &#x201c;No quarter!&#x201d; In a final horror, the battle ended with the massacre of wounded or surrendering Black troops by the Rebels&#x2013;and by some of their White comrades in arms. The great attack ended in bloody failure, and the war would be prolonged for another year. <br><br>With gripping and unforgettable depictions of battle and detailed character portraits of soldiers and statesmen, No Quarter compellingly re-creates in human scale an event epic in scope and mind-boggling in its cost of life. In using the Battle of the Crater as a lens through which to focus the political and social ramifications of the Civil War&#x2013;particularly the racial tensions on both sides of the struggle&#x2013;Richard Slotkin brings to readers a fresh perspective on perhaps the most consequential period in American history.</p><p>Richard Slotkin is widely regarded as one of the preeminent cultural critics of our times.

Between them was a junkyard of broken rifles, smashed kegs, scraps of blanket and uniform, bodies putrefying in the blast-furnace heat. This wrack marked the crest of a wave that had begun piling up seven weeks before and a hundred miles north.<br><br>The Union had started the campaign with high expectations. Its armies were under a new general in chief, Ulysses S. Grant, who as commander of the Union Army of the Tennessee had captured two entire Confederate field armies and driven a third from the battlefield in abject rout. The full strength of the Union was put forth in coordinated offensives on the two most critical fronts. Sherman in Georgia would drive against the Confederate Army of Tennessee with a hundred thousand men. (Union armies were named for the rivers associated with their operations, Confederate armies for the states they were assigned to defend.) Grant would oversee the advance of three different armies in Virginia. The Army of the Potomac with four infantry and one cavalry corps, under General George Gordon Meade and Grant himself, would go against Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia. A small force under General Franz Sigel would advance from Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, to seize the supply-rich Shenandoah Valley. And the Army of the James (two army corps) under General Benjamin Franklin Butler would land on the south bank of the James River, where it could strike against the vital railroad lines that ran through Petersburg, carrying supplies for Richmond from the south.<br><br>On May 5, Grant&#x2019;s army crossed the Rapidan River and was immediately assailed by Lee&#x2019;s troops in a vast thicket of second-growth timber called the Wilderness. For two days the armies grappled in intense close-in combat. Blinded by the thick woods and dense undergrowth, troops blundered into one another, charge and countercharge broke up among the trees, the underbrush took fire, and the wounded lying between the lines screamed as they burned to death. On the second day the Union&#x2019;s General Hancock led a massive assault that nearly broke the Confederate line, only to see his corps routed by Longstreet&#x2019;s Rebel troops erupting out of the jungle on their flank. But Longstreet&#x2019;s counterattack broke against the Federal reserve line, and Longstreet himself was critically wounded. The Federals lost 17,666 men, the Confederates about half that many.<br><br>Yet instead of retreating after this tactical defeat, as his predecessors had done, Grant continued his offensive, marching his infantry east and then south to turn Lee&#x2019;s right flank and force the outnumbered Rebels to leave the forest and fight in the open. Once again Lee forestalled him, moving along the shorter line to seize the strategic road junction at Spotsylvania Court House, where his troops threw up strong field fortifications to offset the Federal advantage in numbers and artillery. Lee&#x2019;s position was in the form of an inverted V, pointing north.<br><br>Grant&#x2019;s strategy required him to maintain the offensive, and if he could not destroy Lee&#x2019;s army, he had to hold it in place so that Butler could operate against Richmond. So he pressured Lee&#x2019;s lines continuously with probes and threats against the flanks, and staged five major assaults, one of which (on May 12) smashed in the point of the V, wrecked one of Lee&#x2019;s infantry corps, and nearly succeeded in cutting the Confederate army in two. But after almost two weeks of fighting, Lee&#x2019;s lines still held, with losses for both armies climbing into the tens of thousands.<br><br>These losses might have been outweighed by strategic success if Butler and Sigel had carried out their assignments. But while Grant&#x2019;s army was fighting at Spotsylvania, Sigel&#x2019;s force was routed by Confederates in the Shenandoah. At the same time, Butler was making a botch of his campaign against Richmond, allowing his thirty-five- thousand-man army to be bottled up in the Bermuda Hundred peninsula five miles north of Petersburg.<br><br>Grant now altered his plan of campaign. He would try again to turn Lee&#x2019;s flank by swinging his infantry out to the east and south and forcing Lee&#x2019;s troops to scramble to stay ahead of him if they wanted to prevent Grant from breaking their supply lines and keep him from getting between the Federal forces and the Confederate capital at Richmond. There was another battle when the Confederates headed Grant off at the North Anna River twenty miles south of Spotsylvania. But Grant simply made another sweep to the east and forced the Army of Northern Virginia back to the Cold Harbor crossroads, only six miles north of Richmond. There on June 7, Grant made his worst mistake of the campaign, ordering frontal assaults that the entrenched Confederates destroyed with shocking speed.<br><br>Undeterred by these losses, Grant now planned a complex series of maneuvers that, if successful, might lead to the capture of the vital rail nexus of Petersburg. With that city in hand, he could force Lee to choose between withstanding a siege in a starving Richmond or abandoning his trenches<br><br>for an open-field battle against Grant&#x2019;s superior forces. On June 9, Grant sent most of his cavalry raiding to the west, to threaten the supply route from the Shenandoah and draw off Lee&#x2019;s cavalry. Then with one division of cavalry and the infantry of V and VI Corps, Grant repeated his by now predictable pattern of maneuvering around Lee&#x2019;s right flank, as if he intended to strike directly at Richmond through the swampy flatlands between the Chickahominy River and the north bank of the James River. Since Lee&#x2019;s army now stood with its back to Richmond, the Confederate general would have no choice but to shift his troops from Cold Harbor to block that threat. But the flanking maneuver was a feint, designed to hold Lee in the defenses of Richmond north of the James. Behind the screen set by V and VI Corps, the bulk of Grant&#x2019;s infantry and artillery were making a wider swing that would carry them all the way across the James River, by steamboat and pontoon bridge, to strike with overwhelming force the single division that held Petersburg and the Bermuda Hundred lines.<br><br>The plan was daring and risky, and it worked brilliantly. On June 15 the first of Grant&#x2019;s infantry corps&#x2014;the XVIII under &#x201c;Baldy&#x201d; Smith&#x2014; moved against the Petersburg forts, ten thousand infantry against a scratch force of twenty-four hundred. A division of Black soldiers led by General Hinks stormed one of the outer strongpoints and captured a Confederate battery. But the inner lines looked formidable, and Cold Harbor made Smith leery of storming entrenchments. He halted to wait for reinforcements. The next day he had three corps in hand, the II and IX in<br><br>addition to his own, some forty-eight thousand troops. For a moment it seemed to the Union&#x2019;s soldiers that they might win the war at a stroke. The low volume of fire, the look of the POWs, and above all the ease with which Negro troops had defeated White men told the veteran infantry that they faced outnumbered second-rank troops. Despite their ingrained fear of attacking entrenchments, many actually begged their commanders to send them in.<br><br>Yet the generals still hesitated to attack positions that appeared so strong, and the endemic failings of the Army of the Potomac&#x2019;s command structure reasserted themselves. Orders got mixed, reinforcements arrived tardily, assaults lacked proper coordination. A soldier in the 14th New York Heavy Artillery described how it was: &#x201c;[The] cry was forward . . . and forward we went &amp; drove them like sheep &amp; held the works for nearly 2 hours till we got out of ammunition then they charged us &amp; away we went back as fast as our legs could carry us but rallyed immediately &amp; took them &amp; held them &amp; the rebs just got right up &amp; skedadalded &amp; our troops are advanced a good ways in advance of where the rebs was &amp; they say petersburg is on fire.&#x201d;<br><br>But in fact Petersburg was safe. By stripping his other garrisons Confederate General Beauregard managed to put fourteen thousand men into the forts, which were as formidable as they looked. They could not keep the Federals from storming their lines, but the cost they imposed in time and casualties prevented a breakthrough.<br><br>More Federal troops kept arriving, and General Meade assumed command, but in two more days of fighting (June 17&#x2013;18) the Federals failed to break the Confederate defense. The heavy casualties of the previous six weeks had reduced both the number and the quality of the men in the ranks. The generals at the front had been demoralized by the futile and costly frontal attacks at Cold Harbor. Instead of obeying Meade&#x2019;s orders to attack in concert, the corps commanders kept questioning his management:<br><br>&#x201c;Is it intended for the IX Corps to go forward simultaneously?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do not understand the arrangements for my supports.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is the order to attack peremptory, or shall I be allowed some discretion?&#x201d;<br><br>By July 18, with Lee&#x2019;s divisions finally arriving in front of Petersburg, Meade had exhausted his patience and resources. &#x201c;What additional orders to attack you require I cannot imagine. . . . Finding it impossible to effect cooperation by appointing an hour for attack, I have sent an order to each corps commander to attack at all hazards and without reference to each other.&#x201d; It was a confession of failure and a fatal error of judgment. Regiments and brigades attacking in succession had no chance against entrenched troops and artillery. The combat veterans knew their opportunity had passed, wrote their names on bits of paper, pinned them to their shirts so their bodies could be identified, and went forward with grim fatalism to face one last day of furious attack and bitter-end ...</p><h2>A Concise History of China</h2><p><p> The centuries-long complexity of China's political experience, the richness of its culture, and the drama of its economic unfolding are the hallmarks of this short but sweeping history. China's own history is entwined with its response to the West in a rich tapestry depicting its peoples, rulers, and society. More than a nuanced history of a vast continent, this study is sensitive to the multifaceted and changing interpretations of China that have been offered over the years. </p><p> In this overarching book, J. A. G. Roberts refers to recent archeological finds--the caches of bronze vessels found at Sanxingdui--and to new documentary reevaluations--the reassessment of Manchu documentation. The first half of the book provides an up-to-date interpretation of China's early and imperial history, while the second half concentrates on the modern period and provides an interpretive account of major developments--the impact of Western imperialism, the rise of Chinese Communism, and the record of the People's Republic of China since 1949. </p><p> Concise and direct, this book is a compelling narrative and handy companion for those interested in China. </p></p><p>This compact and accessible book successfully condenses four millennia of Chinese history into 300 pages. J.A.G. Roberts of Huddersfield University leads the reader through the chronological framework, adding sufficient detail and anecdote to provide color and texture. His writing is clear and punchy: every sentence counts. The index is thoughtful, the book's 10 maps helpful. Though the emphasis is on political history, economic and social developments are also described; for example, the introduction of a strain of rice from central Vietnam that allowed a significant expansion in population under the Song. The first half of the book takes the story to the beginning of the 19th century; the second half analyzes the modern period in more detail (this is probably a useful division for most readers, though a Chinese historian would have laid more equal emphasis on each dynastic period). The author has incorporated the latest scholarship, such as changing views on the status of women during the Song--their freedoms were not as restricted as was once thought. He uses newly translated Manchu sources to show that Qing successes owed as much to the dynasty's non-Han characteristics as to sinicization--a reversal of conventional wisdom--and approaches the dynamics of China's response to the West from a more Chinese viewpoint than is usual. <i>A Concise History of China</i> is an up-to-date and extremely useful introduction to a highly complex subject. <i>--John Stevenson</i>This is an admirable general survey of all of Chinese history from Peking Man to Deng Xiaoping. It is written in clear, spare prose, and conveys an enormous amount of information in rather fewer pages than most general histories. It is structured as a chronological narrative, with the rise, maintenance, and fall of dynasties as the chief organizing principle. It is well versed in the basic historiography of Chinese history as written in the West and comments intelligently on the major theories. (William C.

Now, acclaimed business writer James Ledbetter explores the tumultuous history and larger-than-life personalities&#x2015;from George Washington to Richard Nixon&#x2015;behind America&#x2019;s volatile relationship to this hallowed metal and investigates what this enduring obsession reveals about the American identity.</p><p>Exhaustively researched and expertly woven, <em>One Nation Under Gold</em> begins with the nation&#x2019;s founding in the 1770s, when the new republic erupted with bitter debates over the implementation of paper currency in lieu of metal coins. Concerned that the colonies&#x2019; thirteen separate currencies would only lead to confusion and chaos, some Founding Fathers believed that a national currency would not only unify the fledgling nation but provide a perfect solution for a country that was believed to be lacking in natural silver and gold resources.</p><p>Animating the "Wild West" economy of the nineteenth century with searing insights, Ledbetter brings to vivid life the actions of Whig president Andrew Jackson, one of gold&#x2019;s most passionate advocates, whose vehement protest against a standardized national currency would precipitate the nation&#x2019;s first feverish gold rush. Even after the establishment of a national paper currency, the virulent political divisions continued, reaching unprecedented heights at the Democratic National Convention in 1896, when presidential aspirant William Jennings Bryan delivered the legendary "Cross of Gold" speech that electrified an entire convention floor, stoking the fears of his agrarian supporters.</p><p>While Bryan never amassed a wide-enough constituency to propel his cause into the White House, America&#x2019;s stubborn attachment to gold persisted, wreaking so much havoc that FDR, in order to help rescue the moribund Depression economy, ordered a ban on private ownership of gold in 1933. In fact, so entrenched was the belief that gold should uphold the almighty dollar, it was not until 1973 that Richard Nixon ordered that the dollar be delinked from any relation to gold&#x2015;completely overhauling international economic policy and cementing the dollar&#x2019;s global significance. More intriguing is the fact that America&#x2019;s exuberant fascination with gold has continued long after Nixon&#x2019;s historic decree, as in the profusion of late-night television ads that appeal to goldbug speculators that proliferate even into the present.</p><p><em>One Nation Under Gold</em> reveals as much about American economic history as it does about the sectional divisions that continue to cleave our nation, ultimately becoming a unique history about economic irrationality and its influence on the American psyche.</p> 16 pages of illustrations</p><p>James Ledbetter is the editor of Inc. magazine and the author or editor of five previous books.

Who is the real Jesus? Do we remake him in our own image and then wonder why our spirituality is less than life-changing and exciting? Steve Chalke&#x2015;a high-profile visionary in the United Kingdom and an evangelical recognized not only by Christians but by the general public as well&#x2015;believes that the real Jesus is deeply challenging. And each new generation must grapple with the question of who he is, because only through a constant study of Jesus are we able to discover God himself. The Lost Message of Jesus is written to stir thoughtful debate and pose fresh questions that will help create a deeper understanding of Jesus and his message. It is an encounter with the real Jesus of his world&#x2015;not the Jesus we try to mold to ours. Themes include: �The Kingdom of God&#x2015;shalom&#x2015;is available to everyone now, through Jesus �The world outside your own church needs to hear of the depth of God&#x2019;s love and suffering �Jesus was a radical and a revolutionary! �Jesus offers immediate forgiveness, without cost, to anyone �Jesus shows us repentance isn&#x2019;t a guilt-laden list of dos and don&#x2019;ts, but an inspirational vision of a new way to live Focusing on some of the key episodes, events, and issues of Jesus&#x2019; life, we will see how too often the message we preach today has been influenced more by the culture we live in than the radical, life-changing, world-shaping message Jesus shared two thousand years ago.</p></p><p>Steve Chalke is an ordained minister and the founder of Oasis, which over the last 25 years has developed into a group of charities working to deliver education, training, youth work, health care and housing around the world.

Instead, Chalke says, pieces of Christ's message have been overemphasized and distorted. Like a refinisher removing lacquer from antique furniture, Chalke seeks to strip falsity and tradition from the gospel by examining the accounts of Christ's life in their original context. Clear explanations and plenty of anecdotes reveal truths that get little air time in most pulpits. For example, Jesus offered forgiveness outside the temple. In doing so, he brought hope to people the Pharisees had shut out of the temple&#x2014;and threatened the nation's power structure. Such insights illustrate the immediacy of Christ's message; Chalke says Jesus offered forgiveness " 'right here, right now' and for free." But just as the furniture refinisher risks damaging the original while restoring its beauty, Chalke scrapes the outer boundaries of Christian orthodoxy with questionable treatment of the traditional Western notion of original sin (he cites no scripture in saying Christ emphasized humanity's "original goodness") and of the atonement. Chalke appears to reject the idea that Jesus' death was a sacrifice for sin, maintaining instead that the crucifixion destroyed "the ideology that violence is the ultimate solution." The book's intent&#x2014;to free the gospel from religious bias and expose its unvarnished power&#x2014;deserves kudos, but some traditional Christians may greet the specifics with skepticism. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ian Stewart is Professor of Mathematics at the University of Warwick.Riding the wave of popularizations of chaos and complexity theory is this new contender by a pair of English science writers, Cohen, a biologist, and Stewart, a mathematician. Rather than enthuse about the C words, they ask another question: If the universe is chaotic, where do the simplicities of nature come from? Then they proceed, for fully half the book, to lay out the current reductionist paradigm by which cosmology, culture, evolution, intelligence, etc., are the consequences of lower level ``simpler'' principles: quantum mechanics, chemistry, the genetic code. That done--and done quite well despite a style that is sometime too breezy by half--they spend the rest of the book pointing to the inadequacies of reductionism and building toward two explanatory principles which they call simplexity and complicity. Simplexity is ``the emergence of large-scale simplicities as direct consequences of rules,'' e.g., the patterns that emerge in John Horton Conway's computer game of life; and by extension, any features that emerge from sets of similar ground rules. Complicity is more like convergent evolution: different sets of rules generating similar features (e.g., bat wings versus bird wings). Either principle brings about a collapse of chaos. Basically, what they are saying is that you can't simply map a lower level of organization, say, the DNA code, into a living organism. There is instead a dynamic in which content and context are critical. The argument is fine. However, had the authors avoided cutesy neologisms, visits to another planet, and other textural distractions, their many useful examples and well-taken points might have been even better taken. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The richness and variety of his work and his passionately expressed philosopy of architecture have had a gigantic impact on the urban fabric and the way we live. Weaving through his long and prolific life are certain recurrent themes -- his perennial drive towards new types of dwelling, from the early white villas to the UnitE d'Habitation at Marseilles; his evolving concepts of urban form, including Plan Voisin of 1925 with its cruciform towers imposed on the city of Paris, and his work at Chandigarh in India; and his belief in a new technocratic order. The distinguished critic and historian Kenneth Frampton re-examines all these facets of his artistic and philosophical world-view in light of recent thinking, and presents us with a Le Corbusier for the 21st century.</p></p><p>A huge influence on big Hamptons builder Charles Gwathmey, not to mention on many others, was Swiss genius Charles douard Jeanneret-Gris, better known as Le Corbusier (1887-1965). Columbia University architectural historian Kenneth Frampton, author of the standard textbook Modern Architecture, here offers his entry in the T&amp;H World of Art series. The book covers Le Corbusier's life and projects, from blocks of the 1920s Ville Contemporaine to Ronchamp Cathedral in Notre Dame-du-Haut to work in India and for Harvard. As a short introduction, it complements Charles Jenck's massive, opinionated Le Corbusier and the Continual Revolution in Architecture from Marsilio last year.<b>Kenneth Frampton</b> is Ware Professor of Architecture at Columbia University and the author of the best-selling <i>Modern Architecture</i> in the World of Art series.</p><h2>The Tudor Home</h2><p>A beautifully illustrated volume on the Tudor-style house, a keystone in American interiors and architecture. Since its birth in sixteenth-century England, the Tudor-style house has been a favorite for homeowners from all walks of life. Hallmarks of the style include steeply pitched gables and roofs covered in slate or imitation thatch, bays of casement windows with diamond-paned leaded glass, clustered chimney stacks, interiors of wood paneling and plasterwork, and, especially, half-timbered and stuccoed facades. In the United States, prime examples can be found coast to coast, from the Tudor City apartment buildings of New York to the stately homes of Tuxedo Park; from the cozy, Prairie-inspired homes of Oak Park, Illinois, to the richly nuanced Arts and Crafts&#x2013;inflected mansions of Pasadena, California. In an age when all agree that the McMansion, with its ungainly proportions and sameness of design, should be banished from the landscape, the Tudor house remains a delight and an inspiration, being anything but cookie-cutter, with tremendous variation from home to home. The Tudor Home showcases the wide variety of Tudor homes and the many manifestations the form has taken across the nation, from the famous communities of Bronxville, New York, to the California Tudors of Highland Park. With a wealth of color imagery newly photographed for this volume and insightful commentary on the history, development, and evolution of the Tudor style in America, the book is an engaging read that opens a window on this much loved style of home.</p><p>Kevin Murphy is a professor of architecture and theory at CUNY and the author of The Houses of Greenwich Village and The American Townhouse.

It presents 150 delicious vegetarian dishes that together trace a fascinating story of culinary linkage. As renowned cookbook writer and teacher Najmieh Batmanglij explains, all have their origins along the ancient network of trade routes known as the Silk Road, stretching from China in the east to the Mediterranean in the west. On this highway moved not just trade goods but also ideas, customs, tastes and such basics of life as cooking ingredients. The result was the connecting and enrichment of dozens of cuisines. In Silk Road Cooking: A Vegetarian Journey, Najmieh Batmanglij recounts that process and brings it into the modern kitchen in the form of recipes that are venturesome and yet within reach of any cook. They are intended for vegetarian, partial-vegetarian and non-vegetarian alike -- anyone who is looking for balanced, unusual and exceptionally tasty dishes. The book offers a wealth of information derived from the author�s extensive research and her travels along the Silk Road during the past 25 years. She complements the recipes with stories, pictures, histories of ingredients, and words of wisdom from her favorite poets and writers of the region. <p>The scope of her culinary journey of discovery is vast -- from Xian in China, to Samarkand in present-day Uzbekistan, to Isfahan in Iran, to Istanbul in Turkey, and to the westernmost terminus of the ancient trade routes in Italy. Her recipes -- all of them personal favorites -- include such exotic yet simple fare as Sichuan Crispy Cucumber Pickles; Afghan Boulani, a savory pastry stuffed with garlic chives; Persian Pomegranate and Walnut Salad; Kermani Pistachio and Saffron Polow with Rose Petals; Chinese Hot and Sour Tofu Noodle Soup; Turkish Almond and Rice Flour Pudding; Uzbek Candied Quince with Walnuts; and Sicilian Sour Cherry Crostata. Fortunately, all the ingredients for these recipes can be obtained at local supermarkets and farmers� markets. In recent years America has become a kind of modern Silk Road, where wonderful ingredients from all over the world are available to everyone.</p></p><p>This is the second editon of the book with the stories translated directly from the original poem.NAJMIEH BATMANGLIJ was born and raised in Iran, and received her masters degre in education in the United States.

From Bach, Goethe, and Schopenhauer to Nietzsche, Freud, and Einstein, from the arts and humanities to science and philosophy, <em>The German Genius</em> is a lively and accessible review of over 250 years of German intellectual history. In the process, it explains the devastating effects of World War II, which transformed a vibrant and brilliantly artistic culture into a vehicle of warfare and destruction, and it shows how the German culture advanced in the war&#x2019;s aftermath.</p><p><p>Peter Watson's virtuoso sweep through modern German thought and culture, from 1750 to the present day, will challenge and confound both the stereotypes the world has of Germany and those that Germany has of itself.</p><p>From the end of the Baroque era and the death of Bach to the rise of Hitler in 1933, Germany was transformed from a poor relation among Western nations into a dominant intellectual and cultural force&#x2014;more creative and influential than France, Britain, Italy, Holland, and the United States. In the early decades of the twentieth century, German artists, writers, scholars, philosophers, scientists, and engineers were leading their freshly unified country to new and unimagined heights. By 1933, Germans had won more Nobel Prizes than any other nationals, and more than the British and Americans combined. Yet this remarkable genius was cut down in its prime by Adolf Hitler and his disastrous Third Reich&#x2014;a brutal legacy that has overshadowed the nation's achievements ever since.</p><p>How did the Germans transform their country so as to achieve such pre-eminence? In this absorbing cultural and intellectual history, Peter Watson goes back through time to explore the origins of the Germangenius, and he explains how and why it flourished, how it shaped our lives, and, most important, how it continues to influence our world. As he convincingly demonstrates, it was German thinking&#x2014;from Beethoven and Kant to Diesel and Nietzsche, from Goethe and Wagner to Mendel and Planck, from Hegel and Marx to Freud and Schoenberg&#x2014;that was paramount in the creation of the modern West. Moreover, despite World War II, figures such as Joseph Beuys, J�rgen Habermas, and Joseph Ratzinger ensure that the German genius still resonates intellectually today.</p><p>Peter Watson has been a senioreditor at the London <em>Sunday Times</em>, a New York correspondentof the <em>London Times</em>, a columnist for theLondon <em>Observer</em>, and a contributor to the <em>New YorkTimes</em>. He has published three expos�s on the world ofart and antiquities, and is the author of several booksof cultural and intellectual history.

A timely reexamination of Ain, this book explores his life and work. With a rich mix of gorgeous color and archival photography, and beautifully reproduced plans and drawings, Gregory Ain: The Modern Home as Social Commentary brings this underappreciated modern master to a wider audience.</p><p>Gregory Ain (1908-88) argued that &#34;architecture is a social art&#34; that should serve the &#34;common people,&#34; and he demonstrated that belief as one of America&#39;s most prominent modern architects in the 1930s, &#39;40s, and &#39;50s. Ain helped pioneer several design strategies for houses and housing patterns - such as the open kitchen and the greenbelt - that would become part of the American vernacular. Until now, there had not been a comprehensive study of his career, and he had been, to some extent, forgotten. This book, the product of six years of research, brings new light to Ain&#39;s works and ideas, showing that many of his critical contributions remain as relevant and potent as ever. The book also reveals that Ain&#39;s architectural priorities were tied to left-wing politics: many of his clients were Communist Party members, and Ain attended meetings himself. In short, there is an extensive unreported history of a Communist subculture in architecture in Los Angeles, which was organized around Ain. The `Red Scare&#39; of the 1950s effectively ended this underground movement, and Ain pursued a second career in academia. According to Thomas S. Hines, &#34;In Denzer&#39;s skillful hands, Gregory Ain finally has gotten his due.&#34;Ain pioneered several critical alternatives to basic assumptions about some of the most important issues in American civilization: our housing patterns, our social relationships, and the character of our dwellings. His designs sought to restructure the spatial organization of the single-family house, while at the same time he sought to offer alternatives to the housing patterns of suburbia.</p><h2>Windsor Smith Homefront: Design for Modern Living</h2><p>Mixing glamour with modern practicality, interior designer Windsor Smith&#x2019;s first book celebrates her elegant, comfortable style.
